,investing,"Published 18 years ago, I was hesitant this book would be outdated. It does show signs of age when David Harper gives specific examples of biotechs. In one case he mentions Nexia Biotechnologies which went bankrupt almost 10 years ago. Although there was a lot of hype around the company's product; using [genetically engineered goats](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/spider-goats-display-angers-ottawa-professor-1.1137229) to manufacture BioSteel. Sounds revolutionary and high tech, which makes it a good cautionary tale. It's easy to get hyped about the products but that doesn't mean it's economically viable.

The book did have some timeless advice though. I've made a list of some points to consider when researching a biotech:

1.The goals of each clinical trial:

Preclinical: Animal testing

Phase 1: Is it safe?

Phase 2: Does it work?

Phase 4: Is it safe and does it work for a lot of people?

2.Be wary if the FDA is questioning the statistics of a trial. It's a possible sign the company will have to redo it. This is costly and time consuming.  

3. Alliances are key. Are they partnering with large, well known pharmaceutical companies?

4. Look for venture capital and IB backing. They have a team of experts so if they endorse it, it's a good sign. It's also a very positive sign if the investment bank buys shares directly in the company. Alternatively, be cautious if the biotech is raising capital alone, in which case you have to question why no one is interested. 

5. Look at the background of management, do they have a proven track record of regulatory approval?

6. Burn rate: how fast a biotech consumes capital. Ideally, they should have 2-3 years' worth of cash on hand based on their burn rate. Companies with more cash are less likely to try to raise capital by diluting shareholders. 

7. Be skeptical of phase 3 trials with less than 500 participants. Ignore results when there are less than 100 participants. 

8. 40% rule.

,investing,"# Introduction:

This post will focus on breaking down the differences between 3 of the largest clean energy ETFs, QCLN, ICLN, and PBW. The focus will be exclusively on these ETFs and not single stocks. Now is an excellent time to invest in clean energy, According to several sources, renewables are set to represent ¾ of the $12T the world invests in new power technology through 2040. For the US alone almost $2 trillion is the investment needed to implement renewable energy targets by 2030.

NOTE: It would be wise to keep a long-term investing mindset. Investments that focus on particular segments of the market can see significant short-term fluctuations in price. Additionally, in the past 10 years, clean energy ETFs have had returns that range from low single-digit gains to low single-digit declines.

Alrighty let's get into it.

# ICLN - iShares Global Clean Energy ETF :

Between the 3, ICLN currently has the most assets under management at $2.05B and the lowest expense ratio at 0.46%, however, it is also the least diversified, having only 30 current holdings. This ETF tracks the S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index. ICLN holds a portfolio of 'clean energy' companies, such as biofuels, ethanol, geothermal, hydroelectric, solar and wind industries. Additionally it also holds companies that develop technology and equipment used in the process. It does not have exposure to the Electric Vehicle Market! Of these 3 it has the most Global Exposure.

Top 10 sectors (5 in this case since it doesn't even have 10):

* Renewable Energy Equipment &amp; Services - **59.31%**
* Electric Utilities - **25.80%**
* Independent Power Producers - **9.28%**
* Multiline Utilities - **3.28%**
* Renewable Fuels - **2.32%**

Top 10 holdings: SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. **7.50%,** Plug Power Inc. **7.21%,** Sunrun Inc. **7.16%,** Enphase Energy, Inc. **6.97%,** Xinyi Solar Holdings Ltd **6.24%,** First Solar, Inc **4.88%,** Vestas Wind Systems A/S **4.53%,** Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A. **4.50%,** Contact Energy Limited**3.48%,** Boralex Inc. Class A **3.42%. (NOTE** Total Top 10 Weighting - **55.89%)**

# QCLN - First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy ETF:

QCLN currently has $756 million assets under management with the middle expense ratio at 0.60%. Additionally, between these 3 ETFs, it is the second-most diversified with 43 current holdings. This ETF tracks the NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index, which, compared to the previous, includes a mix of U.S. and Canadian clean energy companies. For this ETF companies are from the following four sub-sectors: advanced materials (that enable clean-energy/reduce need for oil products), energy intelligence (smart grid), energy storage and conversion (hybrid batteries), or renewable electricity generation (solar, wind, geothermal, etc).

Top 10 sectors:

* Renewable Energy Equipment &amp; Services - **32.34%**
* Auto &amp; Truck Manufacturers - **23.97%**
* Semiconductors - **13.18%**
* Electric Utilities - **7.40%**
* Electrical Components &amp; Equipment - **6.97%**
* Commodity Chemicals - **5.97%**
* Independent Power Producers - **3.21%**
* Construction Supplies &amp; Fixtures - **2.45%**
* Commercial REITs - **1.70%**
* Heavy Electrical Equipment - **0.84%**

Top 10 Holdings: NIO Inc. Sponsored ADR Class A **10.00%,** SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. **7.03%,** Enphase Energy, Inc. **6.53%,** Tesla Inc **5.94%,** Albemarle Corporation **5.06%,** ON Semiconductor Corporation **4.21%,** Brookfield Renewable Partners LP **4.08%,** Cree, Inc. **3.96%,** Universal Display Corporation **3.81%,** First Solar, Inc. **3.75%. (NOTE:** Total Top 10 Weighting - **54.37%)**

# PBW - Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF:

PBW currently has $962 million assets under management with the highest expense ratio of 0.70%, however it is also the most diversified with 48 current holdings. PBW is more diverse than just industry pure-plays like wind, solar, and biofuels, it aims to include companies based on their perceived relevance to the renewable energy space as well. Additionally, it follows a tiered, equal-weighting structure and caps any holding to a tax of 4%.

Top 10 sectors:

* Renewable Energy Equipment &amp; Services - **44.46%**
* Auto &amp; Truck Manufacturers - **13.70%**
* Semiconductors - **7.36%**
* Commodity Chemicals - **6.74%**
* Construction &amp; Engineering - **4.47%**
* Industrial Machinery &amp; Equipment - **3.97%**
* Electric Utilities - **3.40%**
* Heavy Electrical Equipment - **3.17%**
* Renewable Fuels - **2.76%**
* Agricultural Chemicals - **2.17%**

Top 10 Holdings: (Remember 4% cap) JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. Sponsored ADR **3.85%,** NIO Inc. Sponsored ADR Class A **3.12%,** Lithium Americas Corp. **3.06%,** Daqo New Energy Corp. Sponsored ADR **3.02%,** SunPower Corporation **2.93%,** Livent Corporation **2.85%,** Enphase Energy, Inc. **2.69%,** SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. **2.68%,** Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. **2.61%,** Sociedad Quimica Y Minera De Chile S.A. Sponsored ADR Pfd Class B **2.49%.**

# Takeaway/Final Thoughts:

Clean energy has a very bright future but the industry is still emerging. For this reason, market risk and price volatility may be higher than the broader market, and ETFs may be more favorable compared to individual stocks.

**For those looking for a Clean Energy ETF that has more Global Exposure and is more diversified than ICLN, I would recommend checking out PBD - Invesco Global Clean Energy ETF.**

As always thankyou for reading. This is not all inclusive so please do your own research to supplement, and if anyone else has any other great Clean Energy ETFs that they may prefer please comment! Have a good day everyone!

Edit: Most sources would say to limit your cap your exposure to a market sector to 5%. This is, of course, up to personal preference, sector knowledge, and risk tolerance.

This ETF tracks the NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index, which, compared to the previous, includes a mix of U.S. and Canadian clean energy companies. For this ETF companies are from the following four sub-sectors: advanced materials (that enable clean-energy/reduce need for oil products), energy intelligence (smart grid), energy storage and conversion (hybrid batteries), or renewable electricity generation (solar, wind, geothermal, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Takeaway/Final Thoughts:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clean energy has a very bright future but the industry is still emerging. For this reason, market risk and price volatility may be higher than the broader market, and ETFs may be more favorable compared to individual stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For those looking for a Clean Energy ETF that has more Global Exposure and is more diversified than ICLN, I would recommend checking out PBD - Invesco Global Clean Energy ETF.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always thankyou for reading. This is not all inclusive so please do your own research to supplement, and if anyone else has any other great Clean Energy ETFs that they may prefer please comment! Have a good day everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Most sources would say to limit your cap your exposure to a market sector to 5%. This is, of course, up to personal preference, sector knowledge, and risk tolerance. &lt;/p&gt;

I recently took a move from my Robo Advisor to my own IBKR account.

My previous portfolio suggested by the Robo included VTI, BNDX, BND, IEMG.

I did read a bunch of information online and I’m still quite torn on what to get as my simple portfolio for mid term investment (5-10 years).

It appears that 80% VWRA and 20% IGLA is quite popular recently, but at the same time, recent posts here suggest that VTI and VOO are good to get for Nice gains.

My personal opinion is that I believe the stock market is now slightly overvalued and I've read a few articles that speculate the same. I know all the stimulus talks are keeping it afloat, but it still feel it's a bit high.

[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378438-stock-bubble](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378438-stock-bubble)

However, despite me believing it is slightly overvalued I'm not very keen on pulling out of my current holdings. I think they are all strong for 5-10 years.  I would rather move for a brief make any new investments into something more stable (bonds). It seems to me that Municipal Bonds are more effective than other options (Treasury, Corporate, TIPs, etc) because they somewhat uniquely provide a good combination of

* Not likely to default
* Tax efficient (federal and state)
* Solid yields

I also read this article discussing some of the risks and benefits and helps explain how they help punch above their weight as you get into the higher tax brackets. I also thought it was interesting that they recommended diversifying state municipals during the pandemic in case of a risk of a State defaulting

1. Should I worry about diversifying states in municipal bonds, or should I go all in California to take full advantage of State tax exemptions?
2. Does anyone have any other strong considerations / worries about municipal bonds?
3. Or should I focus on something else?

I'm not interested in actively hunting / looking for the best municipal bonds - I likely would pick one of these 3 ETFs

* VTEB (Diversified with .06% expense)

,investing,"- SNAP is no longer a social media company, it's important to think of them as a technology and media company, this will help you see the 5-10 year outlook on this company much more clearly

- 249M DAU's, up 18% YoY, SNAP is growing at an incredible rate for an app that many considered dead. Compare this to twitters 189M DAU's, SNAP is gaining popularity outside of North America (India is becoming a massive market)

- Unlike Twitter or FB, who have aging user-bases, SNAP's userbase is the next generation. Most users are either Gen-z's or Millenials. SNAP has the power to reach 90% of all 13-24 year olds in America.

- With a young user base, and $1 trillion in buying power, advertisers are very attracted to this platform, this is why we have seen average revenue per user consistently increase YoY.

- SNAP is heavily investing in original content. Celebs like Kevin Hart, Conor Mcgregor, Will Smith all make original content for the app. 70% of ALL Gen-z's in the USA were exposed to this content in Q3 alone (insane reach to younger generation)

- On average 30 app opens a day, 4 Billion Snaps created every day

- Augmented Reality: SNAP is leading AR tech, and advertisers are moving towards using AR in their ads, SNAP is the leader in interactive/AR ads. (Nike, Gucci, Sephora, MLB, etc)

- Creator Community: SNAP just introduced snapchat Minis to the platform, software developers can make mini apps that live inside of Snapchat - this will attract a lot of developers as it is a way for them to make money. (Headspace has already made a meditation mini-app for Snapchat. Zynga is already developing mini-games for snapchat)

Things to watch out for: 
- SNAP has had history of burning cash, things are looking better as EPS is climbing, so we are on the right track. Just be aware of this.

TLDR:

SNAP has the largest influence on the next generation of the world (Millenials &amp; Gen-z), if you want to capitalize on this generation, then they are the company to look out for.

What concerns would you have?

iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) - It has the lowest ER out of the three standing at 0.46% and it's globally diversified. ICLN contains about 30 holdings, the top 10 holdings account for about 55%. This fund is 40% American and 60% Global. The top 3 countries as of now are the US, China, and New Zealand. Basic preliminary knowledge of each country's economic/political situation can be helpful. This fund contains a ton of CORE Renewable Stock (Biofuels, Ethanol, Geothermal, Hydroelectric, Solar, Wind) but it's devoid of Tech Built On Renewables such as EVs — which seem to be the talk of the town nowadays. This fund follows the S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index and it's Market-Cap Weighted. Overall, this fund focuses on the CORE components of renewable energy.

First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green ETF (QCLN) - This one is similar to ICLN. This globally diversified fund has the second-lowest ER out of the three standing at 0.60%. If you are interested in American Renewable concentration, this may be a contender for you as QCLN is 80% US weight. The top 3 countries as of now are the US, China, and Canada. This fund follows the NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index which holds 44 stocks, of which their top 10 accounts for 54% of the whole fund. This fund is very similar to ICLN though containing a few differences. ICLN focuses on Core Renewable Energy whereas QCLN focuses on Core Renewable Energy + Tech Built On Renewables. Tech Built On Renewables would consist of technologies such as EVs and Light-Emitting Diodes, supported by companies like TSLA, NIO, and OLED.

ALPS Clean Energy ETF (ACES) - This one is a little different. ACES has the highest ER out of the three standing at 0.65%. This fund is NOT globally diversified, with its only focus on Canada (20%) and the US (80%). This fund follows a unique index known as the NACEX Index (which focuses on US/Canadian Clean Energy) and it is Market-Cap Weighted. The top 10 holdings account for about 50%. This ETF is very similar to QLCN (Core Renewable Energy + Tech Built On Renewables) minus the Global Diversification. Ultimately, this fund is a North American focused Renewable Energy Index Fund.

Invesco Winderhill Clean Energy ETF (PBW): PBW tracks the WilderHill Clean Energy Index, which includes 39 stocks of companies involved in clean energy and conservation. Top holdings include ENPH, TSLA, and NOVA. The inception date for PBW is March 3, 2005. Its AUM is $322.1 million, and expenses are 0.71%.

Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) 1-Year Trailing Total Returns: 64.4% Expense Ratio: 0.71% Annual Dividend Yield: 0.17% 3-Month Average Daily Volume: 499,292 Assets Under Management: $1.1 billion Inception Date: April 15, 2008 Issuing Company: Invesco This ETF tracks the MAC Global Solar Energy Index, comprised of multi-cap companies involved in all aspects of the solar energy industry and based around the world, though primarily in the U.S. and China. The company holds around 35 U.S. and international stocks. TAN's top holdings include Solaredge Technologies; Sunrun; and solar power company Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH).

First Trust ISE Global Wind Energy Index Fund (FAN) While solar energy may be the first alternative energy source most people think of, the reality is that wind turbines alone account for more than 8% of total energy generation in the U.S. That's on par with both nuclear capacity and hydroelectric power capacity, and significantly ahead of the 3% share of solar. The problem for investors is that there aren't that many wind companies. But the FAN ETF does wrap up some of the biggest dedicated plays like Denmark-based Vestas (VWSYF) as well as firms like General Electric Co. (GE) that are major producers of wind turbines and related technologies. Together, these components represent the big potential of wind energy.

My account had a restriction on it where only settled cash could be used to purchase securities.

Is this legal or typical in this situation? It seems like the bank made an error by allowing the trade to go through in the first place.

Theoccurrence of such failures in China (approx. 0.1%) and elsewhere (less than 0.05%) remainsexceedingly rare and if a failure does occur, it is immediately apparent to the driver. For the FrontSuspension Aft Link, a full separation typically occurs at low speeds and high steer angles, most oftenwhen the vehicle is in reverse. For the Rear Suspension Upper Link, the vehicle remains controllable afterthe part has completely separated. Finally, Tesla is not aware of any crashes, injuries or deaths, or firesrelated to this issue.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Excerpts:

&gt;On October 22, 2020, BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:BCLI) announced an agreement with Catalent, Inc. (CTLT) for the manufacture of NurOwn®, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The agreement calls for Catalent to produce cGMP clinical supply of NurOwn at its new 32,000 square foot cell therapy manufacturing facility in Houston, TX. Upon FDA approval of NurOwn, we anticipate the companies extending the agreement to include production of commercial supplies of NurOwn from the same facility.


&gt;This is an exciting development for the company as we anticipate patient demand to be very high should the Phase 3 clinical trial be successful and NurOwn is approved by the FDA. Thus, having a high-quality manufacturing partnership in place shows that BrainStorm is serious about meeting that demand and not letting access to therapy be an issue for patients.



&gt;Stock Sell Off Unwarranted

&gt;Following release of the 3Q20 financial results, BrainStorm’s stock has decreased by approximately 40% for no discernible reason. During the 3Q20 conference call the company reaffirmed that results for the Phase 3 ALS trial will be available by the end of November 2020 and we know of no change to that schedule over the past week. While it’s not unusual for stocks to be highly volatile ahead of binary data readouts, which is how we view the Phase 3 ALS results, we have heard concern from some investors that the recent price drop represented a possible unblinding of the data. However, this is not correct, the study remains blinded, and the schedule for releasing the results remains the same. We believe investors who understand the risk of the upcoming data readout could use the recent sell-off as a buying opportunity.

&gt;Conclusion

&gt;The manufacturing agreement with Catalent is great news for the company and patients, as it should alleviate what is likely to be significant demand for NurOwn upon approval. The next expected news from the company is the topline data release for the Phase 3 ALS trial, with those results expected before the end of November 2020.

,investing,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-22/paypal-said-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-crypto-firms-including-bitgo

PayPal Holdings Inc. is exploring acquisitions of cryptocurrency companies including Bitcoin custodian BitGo Inc., according to people familiar with the matter, a move that would expand its embrace of digital coins.

PayPal has been holding talks with BitGo, a company that helps investors store Bitcoin securely, and could reach a deal within weeks, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Talks could still fall apart and PayPal could opt to buy other targets, the people added.

It couldn’t be learned how much PayPal would pay for BitGo if it goes ahead with the deal. BitGo raised $58.5 million in 2018 at a $170 million valuation, according to PitchBook.

Representatives for BitGo and PayPal declined to comment.

Palo Alto, California-based BitGo was founded in 2013 by Chief Executive Officer Mike Belshe. It offers digital wallets that require multiple signatures for transactions, as well as offline vaults for storing Bitcoin and rival currencies. It was one of the first companies in the space to focus on institutional investors, according to its website.

The company applied in August to New York regulators to become an independent, regulated qualified custodian under New York State Banking Law, a press release showed. Custodians like BitCoin are responsible for safekeeping digital assets using secure storage.

PayPal announced on Wednesday that its customers can buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin from digital wallets, as well as use the virtual money to shop at the 26 million merchants on its network. The announcement led Bitcoin to surge past $13,000 for the first time since July 2019.

PayPal said it would partner with BitGo competitor Paxos Trust Company, a regulated provider of cryptocurrency products and services for its new service.

BitGo is backed by investors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Craft Ventures, Digital Currency Group, DRW, Galaxy Digital Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, Valor Equity Partners and Founders Fund.",t2_u75eh,False,,0,False,"'PayPal in Talks to Buy Crypto Firms Including BitGo', Paypal Seem to be going deeper on Crypto than first thought.",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jgkp92,False,dark,0.96,,public,991,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,991,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1603478379.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-22/paypal-said-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-crypto-firms-including-bitgo""&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-22/paypal-said-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-crypto-firms-including-bitgo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PayPal Holdings Inc. is exploring acquisitions of cryptocurrency companies including Bitcoin custodian BitGo Inc., according to people familiar with the matter, a move that would expand its embrace of digital coins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PayPal has been holding talks with BitGo, a company that helps investors store Bitcoin securely, and could reach a deal within weeks, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Talks could still fall apart and PayPal could opt to buy other targets, the people added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It couldn’t be learned how much PayPal would pay for BitGo if it goes ahead with the deal. BitGo raised $58.5 million in 2018 at a $170 million valuation, according to PitchBook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives for BitGo and PayPal declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto, California-based BitGo was founded in 2013 by Chief Executive Officer Mike Belshe. It offers digital wallets that require multiple signatures for transactions, as well as offline vaults for storing Bitcoin and rival currencies. It was one of the first companies in the space to focus on institutional investors, according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company applied in August to New York regulators to become an independent, regulated qualified custodian under New York State Banking Law, a press release showed. Custodians like BitCoin are responsible for safekeeping digital assets using secure storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PayPal announced on Wednesday that its customers can buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin from digital wallets, as well as use the virtual money to shop at the 26 million merchants on its network. The announcement led Bitcoin to surge past $13,000 for the first time since July 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PayPal said it would partner with BitGo competitor Paxos Trust Company, a regulated provider of cryptocurrency products and services for its new service.&lt;/p&gt;

Basically every living organism is comprised of a DNA code that determines its layout based on 4 'letters' (amino acids ATCG). CRISPR related tech allows you to change, alter or delete certain parts of that code with relative ease. Hopefully you can imagine the consequences of this little fact, being able to be an architect of life itself. If you can't don't worry others have already done it for you.

In the end which one should you buy, who holds the most promise? Who will win the patent battle? Which method is superior? I've been following the tech for 7 years and I believe all of them will be winners in the end. I can't predict who will win the patent battle, that's why I advice, if you are willing to invest in this sphere to buy all four of them. I'm heavy on EDIT, NTLA &amp; BEAM but that's just me. gl",t2_2vdt1ygc,False,,0,False,"CRISPR: The four public companies EDIT, NTLA, CRSP and BEAM",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jg9vjg,False,dark,0.87,,public,60,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,60,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1603433459.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent Nobel Prize in chemistry being awarded to the pioneers in the field I thought it could be interesting write a small updated article for those who never heard of it and why it is such a huge opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically every living organism is comprised of a DNA code that determines its layout based on 4 &amp;#39;letters&amp;#39; (amino acids ATCG). CRISPR related tech allows you to change, alter or delete certain parts of that code with relative ease. Hopefully you can imagine the consequences of this little fact, being able to be an architect of life itself. If you can&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t worry others have already done it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are some of enormous advantages (there are much more of them) of Tesla that people speak about, what do you agree on?

\- They will earn 10 times more on each car than usual car company on gasoline car, while they still keep losing money on their EVs

\- Tesla will create the self driving technology and it will earn them a huge amount of money by using the cars as robotaxies, no one is near, because of the huge amounts of data they collect

\- The insurance of car will earn billions because the FSD (full self driving and autonomous driving) will reduce the car accidents by 99% in several years

\- Tesla is going to be the electricity grid company, and it will give them another huge area, and in this area too, they will dominate because of their ability to innovate

\- They will sell as many cars as they produce, because they can reduce prices, they earn 25% on each car, and they reduce constantly the production costs

\- The capacity will grow from 500K now to 2 million cars per year by 2022 (adding Austin and Berlin, enhancing Shanghai, others may be added, India talks)

\- They do not waste money on ads and on dealers, these expenses will go to the customers and the stock owners

\- They do the vertical integration will reduces the expenses dramatically

\- They are innovators, they figure out how to do the car innovations (more than 100 significant innovations) that make cars better in any parameter, while other companies succeed to copy only 10% of what Tesla does

\- They have a huge technical advantage over other car companies and this advantage is only growing

\- Tesla users are fans because they understand how amazing their products are, similarly to Apple, the biggest company in the world

**Initial applications for unemployment benefits fell to 787,000 last week**

New US jobless claims fell to the lowest level since early March last week but remained elevated above 700,000, as the Trump administration and Democrats remained at odds over a broad package of economic aid under two weeks before the presidential election.

Initial applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a seasonally adjusted 787,000, compared with 842,000 in the prior week, the US labour department said on Thursday. The figure was lower than economists’ forecast of 860,000 claims.

The federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance programme, which offers benefits to the self-employed and others who would not qualify for regular benefits, registered 345,440 new claims on an unadjusted basis, up from 337,228.

The number of Americans actively collecting state jobless aid totalled 8.4m in the week that ended on October 10. That continued a positive trend in continuing claims, having dropped from 9.4m in one week and from 12.7m in the span of one month. However, economists have partly attributed the fall to unemployed workers exhausting regular benefits.

The insured unemployment rate, considered an alternative measure of joblessness, dropped to 5.7 per cent from 6.4 per cent.

Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House speaker, have continued stimulus negotiations into this week in a last-ditch attempt to hammer out an agreement before the poll.

Mark Meadows, White House chief of staff, said on Wednesday he was “optimistic” about the talks. “We do share one goal, and that is hopefully to get some kind of deal in the next 48 hours or so,” he told Fox Business. He added that funding for state and local governments was the biggest sticking point.

As coronavirus outbreaks in America’s south and west this summer faded, hopes for a steadier recovery in the labour market rose after big states including Florida and Texas loosened curbs on businesses.

But health officials have warned that other regions, particularly the Midwest, could be at risk of outbreaks. Wisconsin, where the rate of positive tests has hit highs this month, has emerged as a new virus hotspot. The north-east states of New Jersey and Connecticut have also reported a rise in infections after quelling earlier outbreaks.

Federal Reserve officials have warned that the economy’s rebound could sputter without further stimulus from Washington. Republicans in the Senate put forward another $500bn bill this week that would increase unemployment aid, among other measures, but it was blocked by Democrats before reaching a vote. Donald Trump has said he would support a bigger spending plan, while House Democrats have backed a $2.2tn proposal.

The jobless claims report showed that 23.2m people were claiming benefits in all state and federal programmes as of October 3, down from 24.2m, according to unadjusted figures that are reported on a two-week delay.

The US has recovered half of the 22m jobs lost in March and April, bringing the unemployment rate down to 7.9 per cent in September — below its pandemic-era peak of 14.7 per cent.",t2_17czkm,False,,0,False,New US jobless claims drop to lowest level since March - Financial Times,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jfzfyd,False,dark,0.95,,public,866,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,866,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1603401470.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/3323dde1-af89-447f-9b62-cc98d9afe132""&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/3323dde1-af89-447f-9b62-cc98d9afe132&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial applications for unemployment benefits fell to 787,000 last week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New US jobless claims fell to the lowest level since early March last week but remained elevated above 700,000, as the Trump administration and Democrats remained at odds over a broad package of economic aid under two weeks before the presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a seasonally adjusted 787,000, compared with 842,000 in the prior week, the US labour department said on Thursday. The figure was lower than economists’ forecast of 860,000 claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance programme, which offers benefits to the self-employed and others who would not qualify for regular benefits, registered 345,440 new claims on an unadjusted basis, up from 337,228.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of Americans actively collecting state jobless aid totalled 8.4m in the week that ended on October 10. That continued a positive trend in continuing claims, having dropped from 9.4m in one week and from 12.7m in the span of one month. However, economists have partly attributed the fall to unemployed workers exhausting regular benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insured unemployment rate, considered an alternative measure of joblessness, dropped to 5.7 per cent from 6.4 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;

Domino's Pizza ([**DPZ**](https://www.etrade.wallst.com/v1/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=DPZ) \-7%) must be feeling a bit like a burnt crust with its stock down today despite reporting nice upside for Q3 with good comps. However, we see some chinks in the armor with this report that make the stock action more understandable.

So why is the stock lower despite reporting upside?

Investor expectations were running quite high heading into this report after the stock ran from $280 in mid-March to $431 yesterday. The $0.07 beat is not as robust as recent quarters. Coming into this quarter, DPZ reported double-digit EPS beats in five of the past six quarters, including huge $0.70+ beats in Q1 and Q2. Initially, analysts clearly underestimated the beneficial impact from the pandemic on DPZ's business, but this more modest upside tells us that analyst models have gotten more realistic. Same store comps were quite good at +17.5% in the US and +6.2% internationally, which was a nice sequential improvement from Q2 (+16.1%, +1.3%). However, we think strong comps were already baked in thanks to upbeat language from DPZ last quarter. DPZ said in July that accelerated levels of demand from the middle of Q2 remained elevated through the end of the quarter. The company's main rival, Papa John's (PZZA), recently reported Q3 comps of +23.8% for North America and +20.6% for international restaurants, both of which are significantly higher than DPZ's comps.

Overall, DPZ's earnings and comps were quite strong and the pullback in the stock today does nothing to diminish them. DPZ's business is booming as people are increasingly eating at home and looking for a quick and cheap meal. The problem is more that DPZ is a victim of its own success since the company was facing very high investor expectations with this report. Perhaps the silver lining here is that analyst models have now captured the pandemic tailwind. As a result, investors are less likely to have sky-high expectations heading into DPZ's Q4 report.

,investing,"Exxon Mobil Corp. plans to lay off an unspecified number of employees as low oil prices force the company to delay major projects, the company said in an email to staff.

“These are difficult times,” Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said in the message, the text of which was released by the company Wednesday. “We are making tough decisions, some of which will result in friends and colleagues leaving the company.”

The oil behemoth’s job cut is just the latest sign of struggle among U.S. energy producers seeking to weather the industry’s worst downturn in recent memory. Just this week two high-profile mergers were announced as explorers seek to gain scale and cut costs to survive the devastating impact of COVID-19 on global demand for fuel.

Exxon’s stock has plunged and the company has all but ended its aggressive, US$30 billion-a-year counter-cyclical growth strategy. The company was forced to slash its capital spending budget by a third, or US$10 billion, earlier this year. Rivals such as BP Plc and Chevron Corp. have also announced large layoffs in recent weeks.

“Our plan is to continue to stage project execution and spending,” Woods said. “Making the organization more efficient and more nimble will reduce the number of required positions and, unfortunately, reduce the number of people we need.”

Exxon’s stock has plunged 52 per cent this year and briefly lost its long-held crown as America’s top oil and gas producer to Chevron Corp. Its dividend yield stands at more than 10 per cent suggesting that investors believe it may be cut for the first time in at least four decades.

Revenue in Intelligent Cloud was $13.4 billion and increased 17%, with the really cool part of Azure revenue growth of 47%.

The 4th gen Xbox will be released in the later half of 2020 which should include many amounts of Revenue for Microsoft. Microsoft had a total revenue of  $143.0 billion and increased 14% YOY.

Now we shall look at some of the Financials of MSFT. MSFT has $136.527B cash on hand as of Q4 2020. That could buy Starbucks and still have 40 billion USD left over. They have a P/E ratio of 38.76 which can be considered rich but compared with other Tech companies such as AMZN with a P/E ratio of 128.17 and APPl with a P/E ratio of 36.83. This is in line with the coamnpies with a similar market cap.  The Debt to Equity is  0.50. which is very good for a company with MSFT stature. MSFT dividend is $2.04 with a dividend with a yield of 0.92% which is alright for a growth company. The Profit margin is 30.96% which is ridiculous for such a highly valued company. MSFT P/S ratio is 11.55 which alright considering their market cap. The P/B ratio is 13.70 which is high but considering other tech companies such as AAPL with a P/B of 27.5 and AMZN with P/B ratio of 21.86.

Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) third-quarter earnings for 2020 saw the electric car maker post $8.771 billion in revenue, beating Wall Street’s expectations. The results, which were discussed at length in an Update Letter, were released after the closing bell on Wednesday, October 21, 2020.

Tesla’s third-quarter was impressive, with the electric car maker producing a total of 145,036 vehicles comprised of 16,992 Model S and Model X and 128,044 Model 3 and Model Y. The company also delivered 139,300 vehicles comprised of 124,100 Model 3 and Model Y, as well as 15,200 Model S and Model X.

Tesla’s strong Q3 results were likely due to the Model Y ramp in the United States and the increasing Model 3 production at Gigafactory Shanghai. With these, expectations were high that Tesla would once more post a profit this third quarter.


The following are the key points in Tesla’s Q3 2020 Update Letter.

REVENUE

Every week there is a post or two about Zoom. Most of it is superficial. Most of the comments ‘but competition from incumbents’. A lot of it is conjecture. 

I have always been intrigued with this company but could never understand the insane valuation so I never bought in, but Seth Godin’s recent Akimbo podcast episode on Zoom made it crystal clear to me why Zoom is so valuable.

I would strongly suggest anyone who is curious about the stock (long/short, or those who just want to understand the valuation) to go listen to that podcast episode.


Here’s a couple of the top points (podcast made about 20 great points, but these stick out to me):

• Know what else that means? Feel free to Zoom with other countries that speak other languages. Because the subtitles also translate what they say to English and vice versa. Business transactions will be streamlined. Transatlantic flights unnecessary. Misunderstandings reduced.

• Calls and meeting minutes can be transcribed automatically. This drastically improves various other business functions (legal, marketing, accounting).

• How about adding an internal corporate version of Alexa, or Google Voice (or Zoom simply buys one of the other dozen voice assistant start-ups). Yeah, live during the video call you can ask Alexa to do stuff: “Hey Alexa, can you double check those Q3 P&amp;L numbers for us? Hey Google, can you check the feasibility of getting all that product into a single container, and how long it takes to ship that cargo?”

• Stats on speakers. “Hey Eric, you talked for 30% of the meeting, but every time you speak, 42% of the audience looks away from the screen and starts to play with their phones. Maybe you can try this to improve your presenting skills”. Or “Hey Eric, talk less”.

• Using these stats to ‘game-ify’ conference calls

• There will be more than one operator, it is not winner take all and the market is huge (Zoom, Google, Microsoft, etc). Even with competition, Zoom can be VERY successful.

• What about payments? There is an entire sub-industry already that Zoom hasn’t tapped into. From online classes and seminars, to OnlyFans, Cameo, etc, the possibilities of Zoom monetizing this and getting a piece of the action is endless.



These are some growth areas and roadmap. But quite frankly, at $148B market cap, Zoom still hasn’t gotten into the obvious growth areas (think Zoom hardware, unified meeting hardware that works with Teams/Google, displays, digital boards, etc). 

Will Zoom grow into a company worthy of its valuation? Maybe, maybe not. But so far, it’s been ahead of the competition, and so far Zoom is the one pushing the envelope. What company is most likely to add these new features first? Zoom, MS Teams, Google, Apple? The market seems to have decided.

Zoom is positioned to become the platform we do work on. The future of Zoom is bright, don’t dismiss it ‘because of competition’. That is lazy analysis.

&lt;p&gt;Every week there is a post or two about Zoom. Most of it is superficial. Most of the comments ‘but competition from incumbents’. A lot of it is conjecture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been intrigued with this company but could never understand the insane valuation so I never bought in, but Seth Godin’s recent Akimbo podcast episode on Zoom made it crystal clear to me why Zoom is so valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would strongly suggest anyone who is curious about the stock (long/short, or those who just want to understand the valuation) to go listen to that podcast episode.&lt;/p&gt;

Twilio CFO Khozema Shipchandler stated that in addition to expansion in new product categories, the increase in TAM is being driven by new use cases from existing products, as well as the fact that in many industries, digital transformation is just getting started.

On the back of this growing TAM, management said that they expect to deliver 30%-plus organic annual revenue growth for at least the next four years. They further clarified this is not a CAGR number, but that growth would be over 30% in each year.

,investing,"**Introduction:**

Nokia is a stock that has been beaten down and out-of-favor for many years. This year it has popped down into the sub 5$ range (some would consider this to be penny stock range) several times and currently sits in this area. However, for Nokia, markets are slowly recognizing the potential, especially with the numerous upcoming contracts catalysts for the company. Let's take a look.

&amp;#x200B;

**4G/LTE Connectivity for the Moon:**

Nokia was selected by NASA to set up 4G and to supply the other communications solutions for NASA’s space mission to the moon. This particular contract is only worth a meager $14.1 million, however it is just the start. This will be the first-ever cellular network on the moon. The win only reaffirms Nokia’s LTE/4G reliability.

&amp;#x200B;

**Replacement for Huawei 5G in Europe &amp; Other 5G contracts:**

Nokia has landed several contracts to replace China's Huawei as a 5G provider in Europe by 2028 due to security reasons. These contracts for mainly for the UK and Belgium at the moment. By 31 Dec this year the UK will ban their mobile providers from buying Huawei equipment. There are strong speculations that several other European nations will follow suit.

The US DoD [i](https://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2020/10/09/Defense-Dept-awards-600M-in-contracts-for-5G-testing-at-five-bases/2171602260363/)s awarding over $600 million in contracts to test their 5G communications technology at five of its military sites and to incorporate 5G technologies for warfighters.. Nokia is one of many companies involved in this.

In all Nokia has reached reached 100 5G deals and over 163 commercial 5G engagements worldwide. Now Nokia did lose out to Samsung when Verizon awarded it the contract to supply new 5G equipment to Verizon in the United States. This, according to some apparently spelled the ""doom"" for Nokia. However, this was before the NASA and a few other 5G contracts. Additionally, this Monday Verizon struck deals with Microsoft and Nokia to set up and improve private 5G networks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current price and some basic financials:**

Current Trading Price - 4.20$ (21 October)

REVENUE = 5.09B

NET INCOME = 94.00M

NET PROFIT MARGIN = 1.85%

OPERATING INCOME = 316.00M

CASH ON HAND = 7.09B

COST OF REVENUE = 3.08B

&amp;#x200B;

**Risks/Takeaways and Final Thoughts:**

Nokia doesn't consistently beat analyst estimates, additionally, despite a nearly universal consensus that its shares are undervalued, Nokia doesn't seem to be able to sustain momentum. Nokia has been much higher than this in the past. When the company was a manufacturer of phones, the share price ran up above $30. Obviously, other mobile phone makers took control of the market.

The company is now reinventing itself as a 5G powerhouse, with all the recent contracts things are possibly looking up for the company. Value investors seek out beaten down and out-of-favor stocks that are looking to make a strong comeback, perhaps now Nokia fits into this category.

,investing,"Context: I've been long on Nextera Energy (NEE) since 2014 and it makes up a large chunk of my portfolio.

Nextera and other renewables, in my opinion, are looking at a long runway of growth for the next 5 years. Even ignoring the likely political environment in 2021, NEE currently has a backlog of renewable energy orders that exceeds the capacity of its current operations. Meaning, its renewable production will double if all new orders somehow stopped today. Its backlog of orders exceeds 15000MW.

Furthermore, if a democratic administration removes or reduces oil subsidies (as Biden plans to do), the price of renewables will further out compete energy produced by fossil fuels. This will coincide with an increase in battery storage availability (along with cheaper batteries) and legacy automakers bringing their electric vehicles to market\* (opening up demand on energy grids and indirectly providing energy storage).

I'd like to hear thoughts on this (very short) bullish argument and what companies focused on renewables other than NEE that other may be bullish on.

&lt;p&gt;Nextera and other renewables, in my opinion, are looking at a long runway of growth for the next 5 years. Even ignoring the likely political environment in 2021, NEE currently has a backlog of renewable energy orders that exceeds the capacity of its current operations. Meaning, its renewable production will double if all new orders somehow stopped today. Its backlog of orders exceeds 15000MW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if a democratic administration removes or reduces oil subsidies (as Biden plans to do), the price of renewables will further out compete energy produced by fossil fuels. This will coincide with an increase in battery storage availability (along with cheaper batteries) and legacy automakers bringing their electric vehicles to market* (opening up demand on energy grids and indirectly providing energy storage).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to hear thoughts on this (very short) bullish argument and what companies focused on renewables other than NEE that other may be bullish on.&lt;/p&gt;

I think I understand the general idea: prices are determined by how much people are willing to pay for the stock. What you see changing in real-time is the price the stock was last bought at. There is an ""order book"" with all the bids people are willing to do for that stock, and as soon as a buy order matches a sell order's price, the transaction is made. 

However, there is still something I'm not clear about. First of all, that means that if everyone were to hypothetically buy and sell at market price, the stock price wouldn't move, right? So the price can only move when someone puts a sell order at a price that is higher or lower the current market price. But why does this work in the first place?

For the price to go down, someone must have put in a sell order at below-market price. Why would one want to do that? Why not just sell at market price thus increasing the profits? Unless nobody's willing to buy at current market price, of course. But with the number of people constantly trading in stocks, does this actually happen?

In the other direction, I understand why you'd want to put an offer at a higher price, but who would buy it?

I've been investing for almost 4 years and have just passed a year's salary in asset value. I remember when I thought having 5k in stocks was a huge amount but I've massively surpassed that. However, it still feels like my investments kinda stand still and I just keep dumping money into them. For the record, I'm only in broad market ETFs and very much in it for the long haul.

 In addition to its network investments, Verizon has been spending in other areas. Last month, the company [agreed a $6.3 billion deal](https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-verizon-is-paying-6-3-billion-for-tracfone-51600099512?mod=inline_article) to purchase TracFone Wireless from [América Móvil](https://www.barrons.com/quote/AMOV) (AMOV). It’s a move to expand Verizon’s presence in the prepaid and value segments of the U.S. wireless market.   


Verizon has spent a lot money to make these deals happen over the year, and the deals are coming into fruition. Apple sales are up, the 5G towers are going online across the nation. So All in all, VZ should have a decent earnings   


 • Wall Street analysts expect Verizon’s third-quarter earnings to hold steady with their levels in recent years. The consensus forecast is for an adjusted $1.22 per share, compared with $1.25 in the year-ago period and equal to the third quarter of 2018. Third-quarter revenue is estimated at $31.6 billion, versus $32.9 billion last year and $32.6 billion a year earlier. Analysts also forecast $11.9 billion in adjusted Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, which would be down from $12 billion and $12.2 billion in the third quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Jim Chanos said he was joking that he’d invest in Virgin Galactic and that’s fine that’s his opinion.  He’s a old school investor and was brutally wrong about Tesla and a lot of technology company’s.   

I agree that Virgin Galactic has no revenue ... yet and has a lot to prove.  Specifically finishing up final testing this fall and launch of commercial operations in Q1 2021 with the first flight being with Richard Branson.   

The business of space tourism is very profitable and if they can deliver and scale the business with 5 spaceships by 2023 as planed they will be flying 1590 people a year making over $400 million of gross profit per year.  This includes projected revenue from training NASA astronauts and the Mach 3 sonic plane.

,investing,"# What is the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now?

Traders worry every day about which cryptocurrency to invest in. The crypto market, however, is still difficult to predict. There is no simple answer as to which coins will win the race in 2020.

**The guarantee: Bitcoin**

Bitcoin will always be a good investment. Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention continues to lead in terms of market capitalization and trade volume. Almost every crypto exchange can trade Bitcoin and it is the cryptocurrency that is used the most.

If you can or just want to invest in a single cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is always a good choice. The first true peer-to-peer currency is still the number 1 cryptocurrencies. So far, there is no indication that Bitcoin will be thrown from the throne in the foreseeable future.

The next Bitcoin Halving will also take place in 2020. This means that fewer coins are distributed during mining. The available amount grows more slowly, so that every single coin becomes more valuable as soon as the demand increases. Many investors expect price increases after halving.

It is not guaranteed that Bitcoin will experience the biggest growth in 2020. But it’s the most stable cryptocurrency to invest so far.

Advantages:

– Strongest market dominance, largest trading volume

– The most widely used cryptocurrency worldwide

– Secure facility

**Bitcoin alternatives**

Bitcoin clones could also be a safe investment: cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), Litecoin (LTC) or Bitcoin SV (BSV). These cryptocurrencies are mostly faster and more technically advanced than Bitcoin, but will not be able to break its market dominance in the foreseeable future.

They have the same purpose: digital means of payment for the Internet. Your prices often move parallel to the Bitcoin price, but can also rise or fall with a time delay. Some of them have the potential to grow faster than their template, but it is not guaranteed.

– Good alternative to diversification

– Potential for big price gains

**Binance Coin (BNB)**

The Binance Coin (BNB) is the cryptocurrency of the largest exchange in the world: Binance. The Exchange has expanded considerably in recent years and plans to continue doing so in 2020. An investment in the Binance Coin is equivalent to an investment in the Exchange.

The Binance Coin can be used to trade on the cryptocurrency exchange. If you buy cryptocurrencies with her, you get discounts on your purchases. Binance coins therefore have a benefit for every trader. Binance will soon start a decentralized exchange called Binance DEX, on which in turn the in-house cryptocurrency can be used as a means of payment.

That makes the Binance Coin extremely liquid. Shortly after the start of the cryptocurrency, it was able to get a permanent place in the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap. In 2019, the BNB price tripled.

– Extremely liquid cryptocurrency

– Currency on the largest exchange: Binance

– Could already gain good prices

**Tron (TRX)**

Tron is a blockchain platform from Justin Sun, an important figure in the crypto scene. An independent ecosystem for the entertainment industry is to be created on the platform. Every user should be able to upload their own videos, pictures, music, texts etc. without being dependent on companies like YouTube.

Basically, it’s a smart contract platform, similar to Ethereum (which is also a good investment). Users can upload data, make it available to other users and write their own smart contracts.

Tron now attracts a large number of investors. There is a lot of potential in the project. In 2017, Tron’s price rose from EUR 0.0018 to EUR 0.045. In 2018 and 2019, the cryptocurrency gained more and more ground in the crypto world and is now among the top 15 in terms of market capitalization.",t2_7qb5mtv2,False,,0,False,What is the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now?,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jexgbr,False,dark,0.35,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1603253116.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;What is the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now?&lt;/h1&gt;

(I tried posting this in r/RobinHood but thought it might be better addressed here)

I have what might be a very basic question that might seem very obvious but I am fairly new to investing and need some help understanding some of the fundamentals. Please forgive me if my question exudes ignorance. I tried Google but could not get an answer, so I appreciate any help provided to me.

I use a combination of SeekingAlpha and Barron's to look at a company's financial numbers. Most of the time I understand how a reported EPS for a quarter is calculated. If I see, for example, under the earnings tab that the most recent quarter has an EPS of $0.14 and I check this against the Net Income/Diluted Shares Outstanding for that quarter, I usually see an agreeance. However, I have come across two companies today that posted negative net income for the Q2 2020, showed a negative diluted EPS in the income statement but the earnings tab said they posted a positive EPS for that quarter. For one of the companies, Seeking Alpha has an earnings report of $0.14, RobinHood lists an earnings of $0.14 but the income state for the company reports negative net income for the quarter and further down, a diluted EPS of ($0.07).

So the question being:

Is it possible to report negative net income, a negative diluted EPS, and yet report positive earnings for that same quarter? This doesn't seem right to me.

###### Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

&lt;strong&gt;Moody’s Daily Credit Risk&lt;/strong&gt;: 4&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;InvestorsObserver Overall Score&lt;/strong&gt;: 70&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Now, a few words on the criteria I&amp;#39;m using and sources of data.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1. TheStreet score&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener (&lt;a href=""https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html""&gt;https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From thestreet.com:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A (Excellent)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And about the methodology (source: &lt;a href=""http://Valuation%20of%20entry%20parameters:""&gt;https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TheStreet Ratings&amp;#39; stock model projects a stock&amp;#39;s total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;dividends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;subjective&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;2. Zacks Rank&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we&amp;#39;re avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company&amp;#39;s shares. More from [&lt;a href=""https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6%5D(http://(average""&gt;https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average&lt;/a&gt;, from experts)):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;+24.3%&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;a year; more than double that of the S&amp;amp;P 500&amp;#39;s +10.6% .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;3. Weiss Ratings recommendation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website (&lt;a href=""https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions""&gt;https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;A&amp;quot; Rating:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Excellent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a &amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strong Buy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;B&amp;quot; rating:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a &amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is required that the &lt;a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/""&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/a&gt; stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the &lt;a href=""https://www.marketbeat.com/""&gt;MarketBeat&lt;/a&gt; stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;6. Piotroski F-Score&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company&amp;#39;s financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in&lt;a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf""&gt; Piotroski’s paper&lt;/a&gt; from 2000:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;23% annual return&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from &lt;a href=""https://www.gurufocus.com/""&gt;https://www.gurufocus.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;7. Moody&amp;#39;s Daily Credit Risk&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value is retrieved from&lt;a href=""https://markets.businessinsider.com/""&gt; https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both &lt;strong&gt;technical&lt;/strong&gt; analysis and &lt;strong&gt;fundamental&lt;/strong&gt; stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More detailed explanation from &lt;a href=""https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean""&gt;https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  &lt;a href=""https://www.tradingview.com/""&gt;https://www.tradingview.com&lt;/a&gt; (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed the reading. What do you think about this stock selection and the strategy? Feel free to leave a comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;Automobile insurance startup Root Inc said on Tuesday it plans to raise as much as $604.1 million in its initial public offering on the Nasdaq, the latest in a line of insurers looking to tap the current boom in U.S. capital markets

&gt;The firm, which provides insurance to customers through mobile applications, expects its initial offering of 24.2 million shares to be priced between $22 and $25 a share, and is looking at a top-end valuation of about $6.25 billion.

&gt;Sources had told Reuters earlier this year that Root was looking at a valuation of between $5 billion and $6 billion.

&gt;Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Wells Fargo Securities are the lead underwriters for the offering.

**Fact**: Most American companies already derived a large amount of money from Europe, by investing in the S&amp;P 500, you are already gaining exposure to Europe.

[Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund ETF  (VT)](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VT) has about 16.6% of exposure in Europe but none of them are in the top 10 holdings. Nestle, which is included in the [Vanguard ESG International Stock ETF (VSGX)](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/VSGX/quarter-end-holdings),  comes in at number 12 before Roche Holding AG at number 22.

Investing in VGK would give you large exposure to their financial sector which has not been performing well, big pharma (J&amp;J, slow growing stalwarts), Industrials, Consumer stables and discretionary. Unlike the US, they don't have dominant technology companies that are growing despite their large market cap.

**Netherlands**: PROSUS

**Poland**: CD PROJECT SA

How many of these companies do you even know? SAP and SAGE are literally boomer companies like IBM which are kept alive because of their legacy software that's embedded in all the old companies. Most of them are technology but not software companies (NOKIA, ERICCSON) or just semiconductor manufacturers but not AMD, Nvidia or Intel. Sweden's largest 'technology' company makes computer peripherals or a music streaming app.ASML, the only EUV lithography machine makers in the world, and Adyen are the only 'new economy' stocks that are growing. They also have Prosus which is an investment holding company like Softbank but more conservative. 

**My Conclusion**

Only Netherlands is worth investing in for European exposure. The rest of the companies in other countries are old economy companies and large healthcare/pharma are not growing as quickly and are more similar to J&amp;J in terms of growth except your dividends will get taxed too.
&amp;#x200B;

**Extra opinion**

Japan and (Asia) Pacific are not worth investing in too, only Taiwan (TSMC, FOXCONN), South Korea (Samsung), China (BABA, TENCENT, MEITUAN, PINGAN, etc) are worth it. Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand are full of boomer economy companies too. Emerging markets are a different story but in the age of economical colonization, large companies from other countries will probably swallow them up before they can get big so you can't really participate in their growth if you invest in them.",t2_8h0mah08,False,,0,False,[Discussion] Is it worth having exposure to European companies?,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jenx9y,False,dark,0.59,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,,1603196501.0,,[],{},,True,,1603223420.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following this &lt;a href=""https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/jdpz0x/i_still_struggle_to_get_my_head_around_this_aapl/""&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; about Apple being larger than the FTSE 100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Netherlands&lt;/strong&gt;: PROSUS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poland&lt;/strong&gt;: CD PROJECT SA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many of these companies do you even know? SAP and SAGE are literally boomer companies like IBM which are kept alive because of their legacy software that&amp;#39;s embedded in all the old companies. Most of them are technology but not software companies (NOKIA, ERICCSON) or just semiconductor manufacturers but not AMD, Nvidia or Intel. Sweden&amp;#39;s largest &amp;#39;technology&amp;#39; company makes computer peripherals or a music streaming app.ASML, the only EUV lithography machine makers in the world, and Adyen are the only &amp;#39;new economy&amp;#39; stocks that are growing. They also have Prosus which is an investment holding company like Softbank but more conservative. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only Netherlands is worth investing in for European exposure. The rest of the companies in other countries are old economy companies and large healthcare/pharma are not growing as quickly and are more similar to J&amp;amp;J in terms of growth except your dividends will get taxed too.
&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra opinion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and (Asia) Pacific are not worth investing in too, only Taiwan (TSMC, FOXCONN), South Korea (Samsung), China (BABA, TENCENT, MEITUAN, PINGAN, etc) are worth it. Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand are full of boomer economy companies too. Emerging markets are a different story but in the age of economical colonization, large companies from other countries will probably swallow them up before they can get big so you can&amp;#39;t really participate in their growth if you invest in them.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Hello all,

I have some doubts and need clarification on how to interpret a stock's beta value. 

- Beta is the measure of volatility of a security relative to a market. 

-  Beta is equal to the slope of best fit line between the market returns and security returns. 

- Suppose we look at yearly returns. A Beta of 2 means if the market yearly return increased by 1, the equity yearly return increases by 2.

- But how do I interpret the Beta of 2 with respect to the volitility of the equity relative to the market? Can I say the equity is twice as volatile? 

- Would comparing the standard deviation of equity returns and stabdard deviation of market returns be a better way to measure the volatility of an equity to market?

From the post (You should just read it, its not that long)

&gt;Overall sales didn’t instantly fall off after expiration, because the supplementary unemployment benefits were so large that they facilitated many receiving unemployment actually accumulating savings. There were also the 300 dollar FEMA payments that Trump authorized by executive order. These ran out in various states throughout September. The New York Times had some good reporting on a study based on JP Morgan bank accounts that showed the median checking account of those receiving direct deposits of unemployment benefits rose significantly early on, and then fell off significantly in August. The fall off in savings is probably less dramatic for the under- and unbanked receiving prepaid debit card balances or checks, with consequently larger drop-offs in spending when supplementary payments expired. A New York Federal Reserve survey from June showed similar results for the early part of the pandemic.

&gt;A similar story is told in the aggregate data. The saving rate peak coincided with the beginning of the stimulus check payments and supplemental unemployment benefits. As the stimulus checks were exhausted, the saving rate fell. It’s not possible to get a complete picture yet: we don’t have data for September, which will likely show larger declines. With the emergency FEMA payments declining, the desperation that has already racked millions of families is spreading — and so is the virus.

Given the context, it is understandable that most of these companies, especially the ones offering digital/cloud solutions are doing well during these times. Although, the current valuations for most of them seem very speculative. The price gets pumped even more with every positive earnings report and with any negative news around covid.
I think, we can all imagine in max 1-2 years things to return to something resembling the old normal. In that scenario, the inflated stock valuations don't make sense and they will likely fall hard. 

One stock in particular, that is overhyped and I think has the most to drop is zoom. Two main reasons:

1. As things return to a new normal there will be a decrease in usage for such services. 
2. There is plenty of capable competition out there with free/cheap alternatives. One of the best, I would say is Microsoft.

My expectation is that most of their new clients are in a yearly subscription that started in March/April. If things start to improve (i.e. vaccine) I would be quite confident that most new clients will switch to monthly subscription and slowly start to reduce usage as the majority of employees return to the office, universities restart face to face, etc.
My expectation is that in the second half of next year (the latest) we should see cracks in the growth case for zoom - where revenue plateaus or starts to decline and in addition to this there should be a rotation from growth/momentum stocks to value stocks.

,investing,"Hi, I’ve been looking for an ETF that tracks the STOXX Europe 600 Banks Index and can be purchased on either Canadian or US stock exchanges. The closest ETF I can find is EUFN from BlackRock which instead follows the MSCI Europe Financials Index. This ETF is comprised of only 40% banks while the remaining 60% is in various other financials, and it has a large exposure to the UK.

The closest ETF I can find is EUFN from BlackRock which instead follows the MSCI Europe Financials Index. This ETF is comprised of only 40% banks while the remaining 60% is in various other financials, and it has a large exposure to the UK.

,investing,"American Battery Metals Corporation- or rather, per the upcoming name change, American Battery Technology Company (ABTL- not sure if this ticker is going to change) is intriguing to me.  I traded it once, on the day of that recent long, hollow green candle and made a nice little profit (large for some, de minimis for others, depending on perspective).  It appears that per current battery technology, lithium is going to be the de facto maxime amet element for battery technologies.  It is seemingly plain on the face that we are undergoing a transition from the internal combustion engine powered vehicles to EVs, thereby making lithium one of the most important elements in the universe.  Lithium is generally commercially provided for battery production as either lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate (LCE), the global demand in 2018 was 270,000 megatons (mt) and is expected to TRIPLE to 800,000 mt by 2025.  According to Joe Lowry, ""Mr. Lithium"", while the market price for battery quality (BQ) LCE is unstandardized and opaque, the going price in China is about $7,000/mt and in Japan and South Korea about $10,000/mt, but that due to shortages it should rise to about $12,000/mt.  He also holds that lithium, as a raw resource is plentiful, investment to pull it from the earth (brine and spodumene) is woefully lacking.  I've seen such sentiments elsewhere.  On a side note, while Tesla's battery day was a brief but huge disappointment for investors, Musk's announcement that Tesla is getting into the lithium mining business is truly a forward looking and likely wise decision even if it wasn't 'sexy' enough to appease investors and traders at that time.  In this way, lithium mining company stocks have captured my own and, obviously many others attention.  Now, to the point, ABML is an interesting company, having ex-Tesla engineer, Ryan Melsert, as CTO, David Batstone, a UCSF professor, on its board, and Menka Sethi, formerly of Facebook, as COO and the tripartite aim to focus on recycling lithium-containing batteries, extraction, and primary resources (mining).  The company is building a first recycling facility in Fernley, Nevada and \*I believe\* they have claims for thousands of acres of lithium-containing areas in Nevada as well.  The company claims to be preparing to ""process 20,000 mt per year of recycled material with their commercial pilot plant"" and notes that only 90,000 mt were processed in a recent year.

I traded it once, on the day of that recent long, hollow green candle and made a nice little profit (large for some, de minimis for others, depending on perspective).  It appears that per current battery technology, lithium is going to be the de facto maxime amet element for battery technologies.  It is seemingly plain on the face that we are undergoing a transition from the internal combustion engine powered vehicles to EVs, thereby making lithium one of the most important elements in the universe.  Lithium is generally commercially provided for battery production as either lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate (LCE), the global demand in 2018 was 270,000 megatons (mt) and is expected to TRIPLE to 800,000 mt by 2025.  According to Joe Lowry, &amp;quot;Mr. Lithium&amp;quot;, while the market price for battery quality (BQ) LCE is unstandardized and opaque, the going price in China is about $7,000/mt and in Japan and South Korea about $10,000/mt, but that due to shortages it should rise to about $12,000/mt.  He also holds that lithium, as a raw resource is plentiful, investment to pull it from the earth (brine and spodumene) is woefully lacking.  I&amp;#39;ve seen such sentiments elsewhere.  On a side note, while Tesla&amp;#39;s battery day was a brief but huge disappointment for investors, Musk&amp;#39;s announcement that Tesla is getting into the lithium mining business is truly a forward looking and likely wise decision even if it wasn&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;sexy&amp;#39; enough to appease investors and traders at that time.  In this way, lithium mining company stocks have captured my own and, obviously many others attention.  Now, to the point, ABML is an interesting company, having ex-Tesla engineer, Ryan Melsert, as CTO, David Batstone, a UCSF professor, on its board, and Menka Sethi, formerly of Facebook, as COO and the tripartite aim to focus on recycling lithium-containing batteries, extraction, and primary resources (mining).  The company is building a first recycling facility in Fernley, Nevada and *I believe* they have claims for thousands of acres of lithium-containing areas in Nevada as well.  The company claims to be preparing to &amp;quot;process 20,000 mt per year of recycled material with their commercial pilot plant&amp;quot; and notes that only 90,000 mt were processed in a recent year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to invest in this company rather than just try to day trade it, but I have absolutely no idea how to value the company.

**Powell: Fed open to private sector collaboration in possible digital dollar** 

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Monday that the Fed is open to collaborating with the private sector on a possible digital U.S. dollar, but reiterated that the central bank has not committed to actually launching one.

“We will have lots of conversations with industry and stakeholder engagement, and that’ll help us in our work on digital currencies and cross-border payments,” Powell said in an International Monetary Fund panel.

Powell said private sector initiatives like Facebook’s Libra project have accelerated central banks’ interest in setting up their own digital currencies.

But Powell cautioned that the Fed faces “difficult policy and operational questions,” such as the monetary policy implications of a digital dollar. Powell also listed illicit activity and cyber attacks as risks.

“I actually do think this is one of those issues where it's more important for the United States to get it right than it is to be first,” Powell said.

Powell pointed to the importance of the U.S. dollar in the global economy, noting that the majority of the $2 trillion Federal Reserve notes in circulation are held outside of the country.

Powell emphasized that any possible digital dollar would serve as a “complement” to physical cash — not a replacement.

&amp;#x200B;

**Real-time payments**

The U.S. finds itself lagging other countries on payments infrastructure. The Bank of Mexico last year launched a Cobro Digital (CoDi) system that allows users and merchants to transact in digital pesos using QR codes. The People’s Bank of China recently began user testing a digital renminbi, which would allow transactions even without connection to the internet.

Although the Fed is not committing to launching its own digital currency, the Fed is charging ahead with its efforts to bring real-time payments among financial intermediaries. Services like Venmo and Cash App offer quick peer-to-peer payments, but check clearing still takes days for funds to arrive at one’s checking account because of aged infrastructure connecting the nation’s banks.

The Fed hopes to stand up a FedNow system to allow 24/7 real-time payments by 2023 or 2024. Kansas City Fed President Esther George, one of the leaders on the initiative, said the project is “on track” with that timeline.

Although many central banks are researching digital currencies, only about 10% say they will actually issue one of their own in the short-term, according to the Bank of International Settlements.",t2_4r13u89s,False,,0,False,Powell: Fed open to private sector collaboration in possible digital dollar,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_je2636,False,dark,0.96,,public,961,3,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,961,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1603144903.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/powell-fed-open-to-private-sector-collaboration-in-possible-digital-dollar-134913548.html""&gt;Source.&lt;/a&gt; Article pasted below for convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

One note to address before we go in is that these funds are non-diversified: when you invest in these funds, you are SOLELY investing in Clean Energy. Do not confuse this with global diversification, these funds are very focused investments

**The ETFs**

iShares Global Clean Energy ETF *(ICLN)* \- This one seems to be the most popular. It has the lowest ER out of the three standing at 0.46% and it's globally diversified. ICLN contains about 30 holdings, the top 10 holdings account for about 55%. This fund is 40% American and 60% Global. The top 3 countries as of now are the US, China, and New Zealand. Basic preliminary knowledge of each country's economic/political situation can be helpful. This fund contains a ton of CORE Renewable Stock (Biofuels, Ethanol, Geothermal, Hydroelectric, Solar, Wind) but it's devoid of Tech Built On Renewables such as EVs — which seem to be the talk of the town nowadays. This fund follows the S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index and it's Market-Cap Weighted. Overall, this fund focuses on the CORE components of renewable energy.

&amp;#x200B;

First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green ETF *(QCLN)* \- This one is similar to ICLN. This globally diversified fund has the second-lowest ER out of the three standing at 0.60%. If you are interested in American Renewable concentration, this may be a contender for you as QCLN is 80% US weight. The top 3 countries as of now are the US, China, and Canada. This fund follows the NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index which holds 44 stocks, of which their top 10 accounts for 54% of the whole fund. This fund is very similar to ICLN though containing a few differences. ICLN focuses on Core Renewable Energy whereas QCLN focuses on Core Renewable Energy + Tech Built On Renewables. Tech Built On Renewables would consist of technologies such as EVs and Light-Emitting Diodes, supported by companies like TSLA, NIO, and OLED. 

&amp;#x200B;

ALPS Clean Energy ETF *(ACES)* \- This one is a little different. ACES has the highest ER out of the three standing at 0.65%.  This fund is NOT globally diversified, with its only focus on Canada (20%) and the US (80%). This fund follows a unique index known as the NACEX Index (which focuses on US/Canadian Clean Energy) and it is Market-Cap Weighted. The top 10 holdings account for about 50%. This ETF is very similar to QLCN (Core Renewable Energy + Tech Built On Renewables) *minus* the Global Diversification. Ultimately, this fund is a North American focused Renewable Energy Index Fund.

The main difference between each of these funds really comes down to the underlying holdings, sector allocations, and global diversification. Analyze your Risk Tolerance and Circle Of Competence in terms of holding/sector/globality for each fund before making a decision.

I hope this post helps people who are interested in Clean Energy Index Funds. I know there are specific ETFs such as TAN and FAN, but for this post, I will only focus on the main Index Funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One note to address before we go in is that these funds are non-diversified: when you invest in these funds, you are SOLELY investing in Clean Energy. Do not confuse this with global diversification, these funds are very focused investments &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;____________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ETFs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iShares Global Clean Energy ETF &lt;em&gt;(ICLN)&lt;/em&gt; - This one seems to be the most popular. It has the lowest ER out of the three standing at 0.46% and it&amp;#39;s globally diversified. ICLN contains about 30 holdings, the top 10 holdings account for about 55%. This fund is 40% American and 60% Global. The top 3 countries as of now are the US, China, and New Zealand. Basic preliminary knowledge of each country&amp;#39;s economic/political situation can be helpful. This fund contains a ton of CORE Renewable Stock (Biofuels, Ethanol, Geothermal, Hydroelectric, Solar, Wind) but it&amp;#39;s devoid of Tech Built On Renewables such as EVs — which seem to be the talk of the town nowadays. This fund follows the S&amp;amp;P Global Clean Energy Index and it&amp;#39;s Market-Cap Weighted. Overall, this fund focuses on the CORE components of renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green ETF &lt;em&gt;(QCLN)&lt;/em&gt; - This one is similar to ICLN. This globally diversified fund has the second-lowest ER out of the three standing at 0.60%. If you are interested in American Renewable concentration, this may be a contender for you as QCLN is 80% US weight. The top 3 countries as of now are the US, China, and Canada. This fund follows the NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy Index which holds 44 stocks, of which their top 10 accounts for 54% of the whole fund. This fund is very similar to ICLN though containing a few differences. ICLN focuses on Core Renewable Energy whereas QCLN focuses on Core Renewable Energy + Tech Built On Renewables. Tech Built On Renewables would consist of technologies such as EVs and Light-Emitting Diodes, supported by companies like TSLA, NIO, and OLED. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALPS Clean Energy ETF &lt;em&gt;(ACES)&lt;/em&gt; - This one is a little different. ACES has the highest ER out of the three standing at 0.65%.  This fund is NOT globally diversified, with its only focus on Canada (20%) and the US (80%). This fund follows a unique index known as the NACEX Index (which focuses on US/Canadian Clean Energy) and it is Market-Cap Weighted. The top 10 holdings account for about 50%. This ETF is very similar to QLCN (Core Renewable Energy + Tech Built On Renewables) &lt;em&gt;minus&lt;/em&gt; the Global Diversification. Ultimately, this fund is a North American focused Renewable Energy Index Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

Lorl- loral space and communication .on nyse currently trading at 20$ and some change

The meat and potatoes: 

Loral currently owns 64% of canadian satellite producer telesat the remainder is owned by canadas public pension. It is the fourth largest in the world and has been around for 50 years. It has been excellently run by dan goldberg maintaining strong cashflows and important contracts. 
Telesat is currently in the process to create/ have in orbit a leo conetellation for 2022 which is said to cover the globe. So far the tech has been proven strong. 

Telesat will be selling some of its u.s spectrum in december in the public auction and will receive 375$ mil usd which is 1/3 or lorals current market cap. It is also in the process to possibly sell spectum in canada at auction but so far no word on that yet. Its annual revenue has been fairly consistent in the $800-1 bil mark which alone makes loral a value play with a market cap just over 600 mil.

My thesis: 

telesat will be going a different route offering backflow internet to customers with leo( going through existing isp)now some people have voiced criticism at this when comparing to spaceexs direct to consumer. The reality of our world is that many nations will not allow direct to consumer due to censorship as well as the heavily engrained relationships between current providers and government. Which will make backflow the way to go. Telesat is also working with lockheed martin and the pentagon but not much info on that.

Telesat just announced a partnership with nelco india which is huge as india has the second largest internet market in the world and nelco has stong government ties. Telesat also just announced further contract with darpa which could prove to be huge in the comimg years. Telesat also has a large existing revenue base from its ongoing operations. 

The risk: 
Mhr fund is the largest and most influential shareholder of loral. Mhr/ public pension failed to reach a deal to sell telesat for 7bil or 75$/ share in 2015 due to some squabbling. In april of this year loral announced it is in advanced discussions with publc pension to take telesat public but no announcement has been made yet. 

Telesat has already made major partnerships for its leo system so if it fails to secure funding it could be brutal. I for one dont believe these partnerships would have been announced recently if it wasnt a given that funding/ ipo will be announced soon. 

Telesat has the lobbying/ history and tech expertise to be a leader in the space race. Their partnerships in india north america and throughout the world will create a strong customer demand for their constellation.

,investing,"One of the reasons I've been skeptical of $SQ's rise even post-Covid is that investors seem overly excited by Cash App growth, where the majority of revenue is from \*exempt\* debit interchange fees.

Debit interchange fees were regulated under the Durbin Amendment after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), that put a ceiling on the amount of fees issuers can extract from every debit transaction. The amendment excluded ""small"" issuers with less than $10B in assets, which was mainly targeted toward small regional banks and credit unions. Thus, ""small"" issuers that include Square are paid more than double the interchange fees that a mid to large bank get for the same transactions when you use the Cash debit card to pay for things.

Square has been exempt through the growth of Cash App, but if you look at their last 10-Q they are sitting on $7.8B in assets already, and will likely cross $10B in less than a year from now.

For those with a deeper understanding of payments industry:

1. Does anyone know if the $10B asset threshold is for the company as a whole or just customer deposits on Cash app?
2. Has Square mentioned this exemption status and made any projections on which they would lose that status in any report?

,investing,"The first most undervalued is Fannie Mae FNMA but there are a lot of barriers to that investment actually paying off.

With MGI there are not barriers besides the market valuing the stock correctly which I believe will start to happen soon as it finally shows solid profitability again.  One of the reasons the stock is at a low point in the first place is that it lost a substantial amount of money because it had invested heavily in Mortgage-Backed Securities with its capital float in 2008. That legacy issue is mostly gone.  The second reason it became undervalued is that its heavy debt from those losses caused it to borrow money at high-interest rates which caused it to struggle to show consistent profitability.  

Up until about 4 years ago, it didn't have a strong online presence and the market misinterpreted its losses as being attributable to a lack of profitability in its core business.  But if you look at its business you'll see that it has always been a high margin business.  So the company has made significant investments into developing a digital app that is growing 180 percent a year with millions of downloads and transactions that now represent 20 percent of its total revenue.  Even better the company says that digital transactions are even more profitable than agent to agent transactions.  

Its major traditional competitor Western Union has a market cap 24x the 320 million market cap of MGI.  While it's true that Western Union has 540,000 physical locations vs. MoneyGram International's 380,000 in my opinon both companies are way undervalued in comparison to the valuations that newer companies like square are getting in the market.  Square SQ has a market cap of 88 billion, gross profit of 281 million, and a NET LOSS of -11 million.

Western Union had a NET PROFIT of  **$1.058B** in 2019 and because of covid is on pace to have a net profit of about 800 million for 2020 and its market cap is 1/10th that of Square SQ.  

While it's true that CashApp is number #1 in the app store under finance, Western Union is #20, and MGI is number #51.  

What people are missing with MGI and Western Union as far as valuation is that the combination of a digital app with hundreds of thousands of physical real-world cash pick-up points makes both networks much more valuable than one or the other standing alone.  

One of the major burdens on potential senders of remittances is the need to have to physically travel to a location and fill out forms to be able to send money to someone.  Digital eliminates the time hassle of sending money to someone who needs it and it's usually true that the sender of these types of payments is in a better financial position than the receiver of the remittances.  

What I am trying to say is that there are only two companies in the world with the number of physical locations that Western Union and MoneyGram have.  It would take billions of dollars for a competitor to try to build those networks today.  And I predict that when the dust settles these two companies will be able to generate huge sums of money licensing their use to other FinTecs like Square as well as from their own operations.

,investing,"Now, I’ve been practicing with Trading 212 (both investing and trading) for years but didn’t start investing money because I was underage. 

DISCLAIMER: When I was younger, I thought day trading was “the way to go” to make a lot of money (for some people it is... for me it really isn’t). I luckily figured this out before I bought some “day trading guru’s course for ONLY $299”... fucking bargain btw👌🤯 ...not 

I started actually investing in March, and for whatever reason (can’t remember) I decided to go with EToro...

BE WISE ON WHO YOU CHOOSE !

1. Let’s start with the NUMBER OF STOCKS.

Trading 212: Invest - 3012 stocks available 
Etoro                           - 2037 stocks available

And the stocks that Etoro doesn’t have aren’t just foreign stocks like ones listed on the foreign stock markets like FSE or LSE. They also have US companies “missing”. This becomes very apparent when you find some “great” companies to invest in for the long term and they aren’t even listed. 

THIS IS ANOTHER THING - they also dictate who you can invest in. For example, I wanted to invest in Spire Healthcare back in March/April, and even though they have it listed, it won’t allow you buy any shares... STILL TO THIS DAY??? ( if anyone knows why, let me know down below please ) 

2. ETFs

Trading 212: Invest - 446

EToro - 151 - although they do have ones like SPY, VOO and VTI

3. Fees 

Trading 212: Invest - 

Min deposit - EUR 1, USD 1
Deposit fee - none
min withdrawal fee - EUR 1, USD 1
Withdrawal fee - no fees

Commission - commission free, unless you buy UK stocks, then you pay 0.5% stamp duty reserve tax because... the British Government can do what they want 🤷‍♂️

EToro - 

Min deposit - USD 200 - first deposit, afterwards USD 50 ( I never even realised this lol )

Deposit fee: none

Min withdrawal amount: USD 30

Withdrawal fee: USD 5 

4. Fractional shares 

•Trading 212: invest - as little as €1. MOST BUT NOT ALL shares can be bought fractionally as some have a min trade quantity of 1 share. 

•Etoro - min amount to open ANY POSITION is $50, defeats the purpose of fraction shares ???? 🤔

🚨——&gt; Now there are a COUPLE ISSUES with this...

But the main issue is a more PERSONAL ONE. 

I’m sick of having to think and buy my family things that don’t want or need for birthdays or Christmas...

So I buy them a share, of a good company that I think is a good investment. Sometimes I DO NOT want to spend a minimum of $50 😂  Call me cheap lol but I’ve got pilot school to pay for... and it’s EXPENSIVE. 


5. MISCELLANEOUS 

 - Social Trading -

Now Etoro does have CopyTrading. Personally I’ve never used it because I prefer to have an influence over who I invest in, whether it’s the right choice or not. But for some people, they prefer a more “hands-off” approach, so it is good for them. 

ANOTHER POSITIVE FOR ETORO - on their app for each company you can chat with other users, and people can post their latest thoughts and research on the company. Trading 212 doesn’t exactly have this but they do have a similar feature which is a forum separate to the app. 

- Layout -

I personally prefer the layout of Trading 212, especially when looking into the graphs, or even trying to find out what your ROI is. It’s a much more user-friendly interface, in my opinion. 

Etoro doesn’t offer the ability to transfer open positions to another broker... which is shit. Trading 212 will be implementing the ability to transfer from/to other broker by the end of 2020 (supposedly). 

Also, Etoro’s customer service is actually really helpful, with their live chat feature. And doesn’t take too long to connect. 

—————————


Just to top it off - 

Trading 212: invest - you can get a free share worth up to £100 

So IN MY OPINION I would 100% go with Trading 212 for INVESTING, and that’s why I’m switching

I only invest, I DO NOT day trade, use CFDs, swing trade, trade commodities, trade forex or (currently) invest in cryptos

This is why, imo, I believe Trading 212 is better than Etoro

Looking to subscribe to a stock screener with reliable data on global markets and wanted to get peoples opinions who have used all three of these or at least two of them. I do use another screener but because it uses free data, there can sometimes be significant errors. Important points required and a high level comparison below based on my initial impressions:


- Price  (Screener.co is very good value and much cheaper than the other two. Finbox in the middle and Stockopedia most expensive
-Multiple fundamental value metrics and scores (eg pEG, price to sales, Piotroski) (All 3 are probably fine on this count) 
-  ability to create custom ratios from the UI (screener.co is very customisable in that you can create custom formulas. Not sure about the others)

I live in Canada so the entrepreneurship is completely dead because it's like a communist country any type of society that fixates on socialism and taxing is pretty much communistic and destroys entrepreneurship because the more you work the less you get paid that's how it goes it sucks I actually I'm planning to move to America someday I'm a right-wing add person I can't stand this left-sided world but that's a different topic altogether so I won't bother indulging any further

By the way I'm using speech to text so there won't be any periods or commas a little too lazy to do such.

If the USA legalized federally weed and all the states were all greenlet to go I could see baking companies in baking Goods like manufacturers that sell brownie patters and other things of sorts would dabble into edible weed products while the liquor company would dabble into the weed booze Market no alcohol just pure THC and whatever the other chemical is called. And for the tobacco company I get to see them dominating the smoking part aspects of stuff. You have your joints 10 pack of joints for $10 okay that's the average going price for cigarettes Plus the companies have the financial power and capability of doing these things.

Furthermore let's face it no one likes a hangover no one likes to barf while at a party and with weed edibles and beverages like Bacardi rum but we'd infused and no alcohol yes, it would be awesome. Because let's face it you're at a party do you really want to be sick and make a look like a fool out yourself not really show drinking a Bacardi rum that has weed and it would be awesome no headache or feel nauseous.

I don't know what do you guys think you think that some food company and liquor company as well as say Tobacco Company would dominate the weed Market. I don't see why not. Question that remains is will it ever become legalized for entrepreneurship or will it be controlled by the government. At the end of the day. And if so what company would actually take up the mantle Mass producing such stuff.

On just asking is do you think it would be even possible for there such a thing to happen if it does I could definitely see the thoughts for such companies going through the roof.

Oh also when Facebook release the ocular Rift attacks the account thing there's already been Bans and now people have $400 devices that are paperweight trash. The pandering companies like Sony Disney Netflix they're not worth March value in the stock at all they should only be worth like $0.06 a share to be honest. Also the Canadian government wants to tax Netflix big time and any type of streaming services yeah just because they're making so much money during this epidemic it's just a bunch of nonsense.

Honestly the commonwealth countries just suck I'm planning to move to the states just because there's better prospects Shield.

I am looking to create a portfolio that I won't touch for at least 5 years (besides the last stock I list here, which looks intriguing). I plan to invest a relatively small amount (only three to five thousand) as I am only 20, and that is already the lion share of my funds. So without further ado:

T ----- bought a good chunk of shares (\~34) when it was at its lowest during the pandemic. The dividend plus potential from 5G looked especially interesting to me. I'm pretty comfortable holding on to it, especially at the price I got it, but I am curious as to what you think of AT &amp; T's potential for the next 5 years. 

NKE ----- Seems like Nike is really taking control over their products and brand name, closing a bunch of high profile accounts with 3rd party vendors. This new strategy seems interesting and I think it is particularly telling that many experts (i.e. Barrons) almost unanimously list it as a buy even though the stock went up $10 dollars a share this week alone. 

ABBV ---- Seems like a solid stock with a fair amount of potential products coming out in 2021. Plus, they have a hefty dividend (they're a dividend aristocrat) and have the best selling drug in the world, Humira.

NVDA ----- Incredibly solid company with ridiculous annual growth over the past few years.  Regardless of whether the ARMS acquisition happens, it seems like a real champion in a very lucrative field (semiconductors).

MSGE ---- this one is purely speculative.

In simpeler words, if patiënts are born with this deficiëncy, they will have problem with forming clot and therefore a higher chance of bleeding episodes, for example bleeding in muscles, joint, nosebleeds etc. The patiënts with a severe form of this disease, have to go to the hospital every week and get an intravenous injection of these factors. This is called profylactic treatment. Intravenous injection is expensive, invasive and inconvienient. They also have to go to the hospital if they have a severe bleeding episode, to stop the bleeding they also receive these factors, called on demand treatment of bleeding episodes.
2. It is possible to divide the immunesystem in two type: the adaptive immune system and the innate immune system. There are certain proteines, called complement, which play an important role in both systems. They make sure that certain cells, such as T-cels, migrate to the correct location, for example a site of infection. They also make it possible for macrophages to recognices bacteria and viruses, so that phagocytosis can take place (killing of bactera/virus). One example of such a complement is called C3 (this one plays a pivitol role). There are several diseases in which the complement is overactive and causes problems for the patients. By inhibiting this C3 complement, you could treat those diseases. Examples are: dry AMD (macular degeneration), aHUS, PNH, complement-3 glomerulopathy, neurologic diseases such as myasthenia graves, but really any auto-immuun disease could be affectd through this inhibition.

This company has developed four main products:

1. MarzAA, which is factor VIIa, injected subcutaneously (under the skin) instead of intraveneous (directly in the veins). It has entered a phase 3 clinical trial in late 2020. It compares MarzAA with 60 patients with hemophilia A or B with bleeding episodes with standard patiënt care. If this trial is succesful, it will most likely result in the approval of the FDA of this product, generating revenu in the short term. There are also phase 1/2 trials for factor VII deficiency, glanzmann thrombasthenia and patients with hemophilia A with inhibitors treated with helimbra for treatment of bleeding episodes starting in the late 2020. **In others words, in the future, it will probably be used for more than just bleeding episodes of hemophilia A/B.**
2. Dalca, which is factor IX. A phase 2 trial has been completed for prophylactic treatment of hemophilia B. A phase 3 trial is underway in late 2020. So they will soon also produce revenu on the basis of this product. But soon could also mean a couple of years. 
3. An anti-complement factor 3. On oktober the 14th they announced that they have a patent for this product which will last untill 2038. They are currently busy with pre-clinical trials on mouse, to see if it has an effect on dry AMD. The stock price went up from $4.80 to $6.40 on the day of announcement.
4. Fix-gene therapie of factor IX. There are trials on mice; seems in-vitro to be 3-4x better than the Padua variant (Pfizer/Stark).

Everything seems nice and well for this company, however there are a few problems, mainly competition. According to their 10k-report:

1. MarzAA's competitive advatange is the subcutaneous (SQ) injection. Novo nordisk and Pfizer are developing their own SQ variants of tissue pathway inhibitors. They are currently also conducting phase 3 clinical trials! Expected to finish in 2023. There is also another trial by Genenzyme, phase 3 clinical trial, for RNA-interference therapeutic targeting of antitrombin therapie. OPKO Health factor VIIA SQ has entered phase-1 trial. Novo Nordisk FVIII SQ entered phase 2 study. **If you ask me their competitive advantage may very well be nullified as soon as their product is approved or very shortly afterward.** 
2. There are already four product on the market which compete with DALCA -&gt; BeneFix by Pfizer, Factor IX-Fc by Sanofi Aventis and Idelvian by CSL Behring, Rebinyn by Novo Nordisk.
3. There are already three product competing with the factor IX gene therapie: Spark has phase 3 trial with fidanacogene expected to complete in 2021, uniQure expects to complete in 2023 and freeline  a phase 2/3 trial in 2024.
4. There are no approved treatments for dry AMD, however Appelis has entered a phase 3 trial with a product scheduled to complete in 2021.

But the most important competition, which they do not mention in their own 10k-report, is in my opinion genetic therapy of factor VIII and/or factor IX for patient with hemophilia A/B. It is possible to inject the gene responsible for factor VIII and factor IX through a virus (a vector). After delivery of the virus, the patient will start producing their own factor VIII or factor IX. There are currently several phase 1/2 trials for both of these diseases. If genetic therapy is approved, their product MarzAA will become useless in my opinion for hemophilia...their second product DALCA will also become useless. The reason it will become useless, is because those vectors will have to be administrated only once, according to some data even after 52 weeks patients still have relatively high levels of factor VIII/IX. In other words, this might be a 'cure'. Their third product and fourth product are in pre-clinical phase. From pre-clinical phase to approval by FDA on average it takes 10 years. Good look waiting on these to generate revenu. 

**Conclusion**

The current competition is already fierce. I expect their competitive advantage to be nullified in the short term. In the longer term, say 5-10 years, their main products MarzAA and DALCA will become useless. However, MarzAA may be used for more than just hemophilia. But wether they will be succesful in this remains the question, since the trials for the other indications are only phase 1/2. Their anti-C3-complement and gene therapie for factor IX are in pre-clinical phase, therefore I expect them to generate revenu after 8-10 years at the earliest. 

**Question**

However, the three analyst project that the share price will rise to $20 in 12 months. Based on what? For me it is unclear. How do they come across to this conclusion? How do they calculate the value of $20? Is there something else I have missed in my analysis, please share with me your thoughts.

I have some fresh funds and this is my first time getting into the US market. 

I am currently invested in my home country, the philippines and am planning to move some funds to the US market for diversification and also for better choices.

It took awhile before I was able to set an account. Right now, base on my research, it feels like most of the stocks right now is expensive (but who can argue with this since this environment has very low interest rates right now)

What sector and companies are good to look into right now? Which defensive stocks look attractive for you guys and why?

Fresh funds that I have now is something i can let it sleep for the next 5 to 10 years. Are there any 10,20 baggers are you guys eyeing?

The style I like to practice on is value base investing since I dont have the time to be actively trading and investing in companies with sound fundamentals makes me sleep at night when market falls.

&lt;p&gt;I am currently invested in my home country, the philippines and am planning to move some funds to the US market for diversification and also for better choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took awhile before I was able to set an account. Right now, base on my research, it feels like most of the stocks right now is expensive (but who can argue with this since this environment has very low interest rates right now)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What sector and companies are good to look into right now? Which defensive stocks look attractive for you guys and why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fresh funds that I have now is something i can let it sleep for the next 5 to 10 years. Are there any 10,20 baggers are you guys eyeing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The style I like to practice on is value base investing since I dont have the time to be actively trading and investing in companies with sound fundamentals makes me sleep at night when market falls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am not keen into tech since valuation seems too high at the moment (unless there are companies that you guys feel I should look into that is currently cheap with a good track record)&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"I am quite new to investing and have a question about which investing strategies to use as matches to having (or believing one has) knowledge about the world.

In other words, if someone believes they have a model of how the world works regarding pandemics, tech, hospitality, etc., and they want to align the MANY investment strategies available to take advantage of that knowledge.

For example:

- If I want to buy into a crash caused by uncertainty around the US election and/or COVID, around the first two weeks of November, what strategy should I use?
- If I want to buy into Recovery Stocks, which are staples like air travel and hospitality that were devastated by the pandemic, what strategy do I use?;
- And finally, if I think that certain stocks like Amazon and Nvidia are so well positioned over time that I believe they will almost definitely improve over the next 2-5 years at least, what strategy do I use for that?

As a novice who has done only initial research, it seems that each type of trading strategy, such as naked options, spreads, or straight stock purchases, might be uniquely suited to certain types of trend or pattern in the markets.

And as a complete noob, I have no idea how to best match those strategies with my (supposed) knowledge. The only advantage I have is knowing how much I don’t know.

My unskilled plan would be something like the following:

- If I’m anticipating a big dip around election time, wait for the general market to crash and buy regular stocks in things that I expect to rebound very quickly, such as Amazon, Zoom, etc.
- If I’m anticipating a vaccine, buy Recovery Stocks now before the vaccine comes out, to be sold within a few months after they recover.
- If I think companies like Zoom and Amazon are going to be fast risers in the next 5-10 years, buy cash-backed PUTs to benefit from the stock or—worst case—be “stuck” with a great stock in the longterm.

This is what I would do right now, given like 3 hours of YouTube study, but I would love to hear how bad this strategy is, and/or what I should study to better approach the situation.

Thanks in advance.",t2_1vo4,False,,0,False,A Question on Matching Investing Strategies to World Knowledge,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jcnu2n,False,dark,0.33,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,True,,False,,[],{},,True,,1602932955.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am quite new to investing and have a question about which investing strategies to use as matches to having (or believing one has) knowledge about the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, if someone believes they have a model of how the world works regarding pandemics, tech, hospitality, etc., and they want to align the MANY investment strategies available to take advantage of that knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I want to buy into a crash caused by uncertainty around the US election and/or COVID, around the first two weeks of November, what strategy should I use?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I want to buy into Recovery Stocks, which are staples like air travel and hospitality that were devastated by the pandemic, what strategy do I use?;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally, if I think that certain stocks like Amazon and Nvidia are so well positioned over time that I believe they will almost definitely improve over the next 2-5 years at least, what strategy do I use for that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a novice who has done only initial research, it seems that each type of trading strategy, such as naked options, spreads, or straight stock purchases, might be uniquely suited to certain types of trend or pattern in the markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as a complete noob, I have no idea how to best match those strategies with my (supposed) knowledge. The only advantage I have is knowing how much I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My unskilled plan would be something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I’m anticipating a big dip around election time, wait for the general market to crash and buy regular stocks in things that I expect to rebound very quickly, such as Amazon, Zoom, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I’m anticipating a vaccine, buy Recovery Stocks now before the vaccine comes out, to be sold within a few months after they recover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I think companies like Zoom and Amazon are going to be fast risers in the next 5-10 years, buy cash-backed PUTs to benefit from the stock or—worst case—be “stuck” with a great stock in the longterm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I would do right now, given like 3 hours of YouTube study, but I would love to hear how bad this strategy is, and/or what I should study to better approach the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Because Reddit seems to be good at picking out winners not only in the short term, but in 4-5 year time spans as well… I’ve seen a lot of topics from 2016-2017 where people were bullish on companies like AMD (40x), MSFT (4x), NVDA (20x), TSLA (9x). Some were bullish on failures like GE, and Intel but even if you picked those as well, you still would’ve been up tremendously over the market.

The stocks that Reddit were hyping 4-5 months ago and are still hyping up today, NET (1.8x), DKNG (2.5x), SQ (3x), ARKK (2x) have also done very well… And it’s not like these are short term stocks either. They all have huge growth opportunities 5-10 years down the line.

In contrast on average it takes 7 years for an S&amp;P 500 ETF to 2x. Statistically, it would take 7+ years for my investment in VTI to reach the same % gains as the investment I made in DKNG 5 months ago. Furthermore you’d have to wait 20+ years just for VOO and VTI to reach 8x valuations. Most of us would be in our late 40s, or early 50s by then.

As a young person I’d rather take a medium risk, high reward opportunity, than a very-low risk low-reward opportunity.

And yet over and over again, we’re told that very few people are able to beat the market, and you’re better off just dumping everything into an S&amp;P 500 index fund and holding. But the more I lurk on this subreddit and various other investing communities, the more I question that statement.

I’m thinking many people underperform the market because they make emotional decisions. They try to time the market, sell innovative companies for a measly 1.5x gain only to buy back again at a higher price due to fomo, liquidate everything on the slightest hint of bad news and so forth. Just like the statistic that got posted, where the Magellan Fund averaged 20% / year over 10 years, but the people who bought into the fund actually had a net negative. And overall there are far more investors like that in general rather than people who know to just buy and hold onto a stock with long term prospects.",t2_5gy8a,False,,0,False,What is the truth behind the statement that very few people are able to beat the market?,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jcgv0o,False,dark,0.89,,public,207,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,207,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1602906461.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Reddit seems to be good at picking out winners not only in the short term, but in 4-5 year time spans as well… I’ve seen a lot of topics from 2016-2017 where people were bullish on companies like AMD (40x), MSFT (4x), NVDA (20x), TSLA (9x).

&lt;p&gt;In contrast on average it takes 7 years for an S&amp;amp;P 500 ETF to 2x. Statistically, it would take 7+ years for my investment in VTI to reach the same % gains as the investment I made in DKNG 5 months ago. Furthermore you’d have to wait 20+ years just for VOO and VTI to reach 8x valuations. Most of us would be in our late 40s, or early 50s by then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a young person I’d rather take a medium risk, high reward opportunity, than a very-low risk low-reward opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet over and over again, we’re told that very few people are able to beat the market, and you’re better off just dumping everything into an S&amp;amp;P 500 index fund and holding. But the more I lurk on this subreddit and various other investing communities, the more I question that statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking many people underperform the market because they make emotional decisions. They try to time the market, sell innovative companies for a measly 1.5x gain only to buy back again at a higher price due to fomo, liquidate everything on the slightest hint of bad news and so forth. Just like the statistic that got posted, where the Magellan Fund averaged 20% / year over 10 years, but the people who bought into the fund actually had a net negative. And overall there are far more investors like that in general rather than people who know to just buy and hold onto a stock with long term prospects.&lt;/p&gt;

In reality I am looking why I could be wrong and why this is a terrible investment.

Is David Sinclair full of it? And if yes, why?

He is doing research on anti-aging.

Here is a summary video interviewing him:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRt7LjqJ45k

He has also been on Joe Rogan show and is pretty popular in anti-aging, longevity community.

Theoretically one should be able to invest in his company: 

https://www.linkedin.com/company/lifebiosciences

https://sharespost.com/life-biosciences_stock/ 

they are on SharePost.

If one buys pre-ipo of a company that will solve aging, that would be insane.
No guarantee he will do that, but... Won't this be the next big thing aside Space/AI?

We already had the electric car boom. Pretty much reached its peak.
We had the FAANG stock boom, AI, tech.

This is something people haven't been paying much attention to.

Longevity and anti-aging.

And its even bigger than all else. Not everyone needs a car, but literally everyone wants to be not age and not suffer from age related diseases.

No guarantee Sinclair will be guy to find cure, but someone eventually will, right? Ok, maybe in 20-30 years, but some company will.

And you just need to get in on early in Pre-IPO via SharePost, EquityZen or ForgeGlobal and sit tight, right?

Or do you think this is quite stupid and naive even?

Maybe he has built up all this reputation and hype only to cash out on his company by doing experiments on rats

 I've noticed that so many things in medicine work on rats, but not on humans.

Maybe some huge pharma company will solve this sooner, someone like Jonhson&amp;Jonhson or GSC? What are the biggests risks here?

I guess smart person would look at all the competitors also. Its not like Sinclair found this one cure and other major pharma companies or cosmetics companies are straight up ignoring it.

It's not like Johnson and Johnson don't have teams researching this stuff as well, also checking out stuff that Sinclair has done and doing their own research on it.

&lt;p&gt;No guarantee Sinclair will be guy to find cure, but someone eventually will, right? Ok, maybe in 20-30 years, but some company will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you just need to get in on early in Pre-IPO via SharePost, EquityZen or ForgeGlobal and sit tight, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or do you think this is quite stupid and naive even?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe he has built up all this reputation and hype only to cash out on his company by doing experiments on rats&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve noticed that so many things in medicine work on rats, but not on humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe some huge pharma company will solve this sooner, someone like Jonhson&amp;amp;Jonhson or GSC? What are the biggests risks here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess smart person would look at all the competitors also. Its not like Sinclair found this one cure and other major pharma companies or cosmetics companies are straight up ignoring it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like Johnson and Johnson don&amp;#39;t have teams researching this stuff as well, also checking out stuff that Sinclair has done and doing their own research on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for wall of text. Just an interesting area to think about that many I don&amp;#39;t think are paying attention to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone here has experience investing in anti-aging, longevity companies, would be happy to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;

Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - October 16, 2020) - GoldSpot Discoveries Corp. (**TSXV: SPOT**) (the ""**Company**"" or ""**GoldSpot**"") is pleased to announce a commercial agreement with Calibre Mining Corp. (""Calibre"") to create prospectivity maps and 3D targets for the Limon, Libertad and Pavon projects located in Nicaragua.

GoldSpot will process, integrate, and interpret underground and exploration drilling data in and around the Limon, Libertad and Pavon projects using its proprietary fusion combination of geoscience, data analytics, and artificial intelligence algorithms. GoldSpot will process, integrate, and interpret underground and exploration data, working to examine all available data, including geophysics, geochemistry, structural data and drill core photos.

""The examination of drill core photos is the most anticipated aspect of this engagement, utilizing our proprietary new tool - LithoLens,"" remarked Denis Laviolette, Executive Chairman and President of GoldSpot Discoveries. ""At GoldSpot, we believe old core photos are an incredibly valuable dataset, although they aren't being used to add value by most companies. Our LithoLens platform allows us to take old core photos and transform them into intact, geo-referenced digital core images, and then apply deep learning algorithms that enhance these images and extract valuable geological information. We are eager to put LithoLens to work on over 300,000 meters of core to produce fresh and accurate geological logs for El limon and Libertad to help identify high value drill targets.""",t2_7sn9nnnc,False,,0,False,Goldspot Discoveries,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jccark,False,dark,0.55,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1602892242.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;After having been put onto this stock through a post on Reddit over a month ago:&lt;br/&gt;

,investing,"Hi everybody!

I'm doing my DD on LLNW and was wondering what the hivemind thinks of this company. The company provides CDN services, specifically focusing on video content delivery. 

I personally think this will become more and more important in the future. Not only because big companies like Disney are focusing more on streaming services, but also because of a change in how people work and learn (more remote working and learning means more demand for quality training videos and the like).

Besides, with large parts of the world sitting at home right now, demand for video streaming is bound to be strong for some time to come.

Besides this, it seems that the market valuation of LLNW is lagging behind that of its peers (look at Fastly, for instance). The stock has come up about 100% from its lows earlier this year, but at a market cap of roughly 750 million is still seems cheap compared to is peers. 

My major concern is that the company isn't making a profit (on roughly 200M in revenue), and that (former) employees don't seem to have faith in management. I'm also not technically gifted enough to understand how Limelight's tech holds up against it peers. They also seem to have high customer churn, which isn't a great sign (although management says it's adressing that issue).

On the pro side, I see major demand for these types of services, especiaily when it comes to video delivery, and it seems that Limelight is undervalued compared to its peers.

,investing,"Hi, fairly seasoned investor here. I've done fairly well this year (up roughly 55% YTD and actively managing my portfolio daily). Honestly, I'm a bit bewildered by all the love for tech that still exists here. To me, it's pretty obvious that from here on out, the next 40-50% gains will come from the recovery stocks, not tech. 

What do I mean by recovery stocks? Retail, commercial real estate, airlines, casinos, cruise lines, financials.

Why? Allow me to borrow a couple minutes of your time.

**Vaccine vaccine vaccine.** There is a widespread belief, which I agree with, that we will not have an approved vaccine available for the public to use until early next year. However, that is a dumb reason to not buy recovery stocks. The question you should be asking is: will we know that one of the many vaccines that are out there is effective and safe by the end of this year? Once we have a vaccine candidate that we know is effective and is safe, then the game is over. It does not matter if that vaccine won't be approved for a few weeks after, or won't be available for widespread use for a few months. The market looks forward. Once it becomes clear that a vaccine is ready and is coming sometime within the next 6 months, the recovery stocks will boom. 

So, when will we know? Pfizer has said that they should know by the end of October whether a vaccine is effective, and will release some data around then. If their Phase 3 data is positive, then I expect a huge rally in the recovery stocks. I expect their phase 3 data to be positive, given the positive phase 1/2 data, the cloaked positive comments in the press by Pfizer execs, and my belief in mRNA's potential.

**Ok well even if we get a vaccine approved we don't know if people will even take it, right?**. Of course they will. Sure, there will likely be only a small cohort of brave souls initially who take it, but once they take it and find it effective and low on side effects, they will tell their circle of friends/family, some of whom will then take it themselves, and then tell their circle, etc. etc. People want someone else to be one of the first to take it, but like with many things, once they hear it recommended from their friends who took it, they will themselves take it. Also, let's not forget that we won't need 100% vaccination rate for things to get back to mostly normal, and a lot of activities that were previously restricted (like international travel) will likely be available again only to vaccinated folks, which will further boost vaccination rates and create a self-reinforcing cycle.

**Ok but things will never fully return back to the way things were, right?** Probably not 100%, but I think 80%, yes, and much more quickly than you think. There is so much fearful talk of remote work being the way forward, and that no one wants offices anymore, and why would you ever travel for business again. I think this is all blown WAY out of proportion. For God's sakes guys, this is the way we've been doing things for many decades. People's habits won't just change on a dime like that because of a 9-12 month situation that is temporary. People will still want to see each other face to face, people will still go to offices, etc. I mean, I work remotely for my job, and it sucks. Meetings are confusing, I find myself procrastinating and not being nearly as efficient/productive as I was when I was in an office, team cohesion is down. Many employers do not like remote work because productivity is decreased significantly, and it's employers who will set the policy. Now, sure, maybe we have more remote work than we did before. Maybe it's an option for some people, maybe you work 1-2 days remotely per week or something, fine. But I don't think this justifies a 300-600% run up in some of these work from home stocks, and I expect to see those absolutely crater once we have a vaccine.

**Ok, but the stock prices of these recovery stocks won't return to normal for quite a while, right?** Not only will they, but they'll surpass their previous pre-covid levels. Why? The Fed, and short covering. The Fed has inflated the prices of all the 'hot' stocks. PTON, ZM, FSLY, etc. all have had huge run ups because tech was hot, and people had a lot of money to invest. Once the recovery stocks are hot, they will be inflated too. The Fed has committed to keeping rates low for at least another couple years (due to wanting inflation pegged at 2%), so rates will be low even after we have a vaccine. Short interest in some of the recovery names are also quite high, so short covering will drive these stocks even higher than you'd expect.

**Ok, but, a second wave is coming, right?** Probably, but a second wave at this point should mean nothing to recovery stocks. It's all about the vaccine. If a vaccine is shown to be effective in November, but we get hit with a second wave in December, who cares? Yes maybe these companies will have 1-2 months of pain, but again, the market looks way forward, and once you have a vaccine, the light at the end of the tunnel will be blaring, and you'll ignore the bumps on the way.

**Ok, so why not just buy the recovery stocks when/if they come out with positive data?** Yeah, you could I guess, if you're a very risk averse investor or not totally convinced. However, I would not be surprised to see some of the more hard hit recovery stocks up by 15-20% after positive vaccine data (for example, ALK was \~$65 pre-covid, but is now at \~$38. If a vaccine is shown to be effective tomorrow let's say, I don't think it'd be unreasonable to see that stock shoot up to $44 pre-market). Even then I'd still expect more upside though, so I'd be a buyer there. However, I'd personally prefer to cash in on those 15-20% gains as well as the future upside, which is why I'm a buyer here.

**Ok, well, what are the risks?** The risks are mainly around a covid vaccine not being effective or being unsafe. If that happens, then recovery stocks will take a serious beating. You also may see some short term pain if covid cases jump before vaccine data is released, as some folks/algos in the market take that as meaning 'sell recovery, buy tech'. Also, make sure you buy companies with very strong balance sheets, as if there are any unexpected bumps in the road with a vaccine, you don't want to be stuck with a company you're worried about going bankrupt.

**I would really really appreciate feedback on this.** I'm investing a lot of money in these stocks, and am by no means blind to the risks. I would really love hearing from everyone here about the things I missed or am not considering. If you have something I'm missing, and can potentially save me many many thousands of dollars, please please take a few minutes and just share that comment here.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ok, but the stock prices of these recovery stocks won&amp;#39;t return to normal for quite a while, right?&lt;/strong&gt; Not only will they, but they&amp;#39;ll surpass their previous pre-covid levels. Why? The Fed, and short covering. The Fed has inflated the prices of all the &amp;#39;hot&amp;#39; stocks. PTON, ZM, FSLY, etc. all have had huge run ups because tech was hot, and people had a lot of money to invest. Once the recovery stocks are hot, they will be inflated too. The Fed has committed to keeping rates low for at least another couple years (due to wanting inflation pegged at 2%), so rates will be low even after we have a vaccine. Short interest in some of the recovery names are also quite high, so short covering will drive these stocks even higher than you&amp;#39;d expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ok, but, a second wave is coming, right?&lt;/strong&gt; Probably, but a second wave at this point should mean nothing to recovery stocks. It&amp;#39;s all about the vaccine. If a vaccine is shown to be effective in November, but we get hit with a second wave in December, who cares? Yes maybe these companies will have 1-2 months of pain, but again, the market looks way forward, and once you have a vaccine, the light at the end of the tunnel will be blaring, and you&amp;#39;ll ignore the bumps on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ok, so why not just buy the recovery stocks when/if they come out with positive data?&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, you could I guess, if you&amp;#39;re a very risk averse investor or not totally convinced. However, I would not be surprised to see some of the more hard hit recovery stocks up by 15-20% after positive vaccine data (for example, ALK was ~$65 pre-covid, but is now at ~$38. If a vaccine is shown to be effective tomorrow let&amp;#39;s say, I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;d be unreasonable to see that stock shoot up to $44 pre-market). Even then I&amp;#39;d still expect more upside though, so I&amp;#39;d be a buyer there. However, I&amp;#39;d personally prefer to cash in on those 15-20% gains as well as the future upside, which is why I&amp;#39;m a buyer here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ok, well, what are the risks?&lt;/strong&gt; The risks are mainly around a covid vaccine not being effective or being unsafe. If that happens, then recovery stocks will take a serious beating. You also may see some short term pain if covid cases jump before vaccine data is released, as some folks/algos in the market take that as meaning &amp;#39;sell recovery, buy tech&amp;#39;. Also, make sure you buy companies with very strong balance sheets, as if there are any unexpected bumps in the road with a vaccine, you don&amp;#39;t want to be stuck with a company you&amp;#39;re worried about going bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would really really appreciate feedback on this.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;m investing a lot of money in these stocks, and am by no means blind to the risks. I would really love hearing from everyone here about the things I missed or am not considering. If you have something I&amp;#39;m missing, and can potentially save me many many thousands of dollars, please please take a few minutes and just share that comment here. Thanks for your time reading this!&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Is the see-sawing strategy of writing covered-calls and selling cash-covered puts to collect premiums a bad strategy?

I'm not an expert but I'm sure there is a downside I am not seeing. 

Example would be find a stock you like that has good premiums on its options (like TSLA or AAPL for example).
Write a put with the cash already in your account to collect premium while waiting for a stock you like to come to a more reasonable price/entry point.
For example, TSLA. I have 50k in my account. Puts for Nov 20 (36 days out) 360 @ ~10 or 400 @ ~20. So I can collect either 1k or 2k depending on what price I'd like to try an buy at. Comes out to 2.7% or 5% respectively, I'd be earning on the 36k and 40k I have sitting in the account. Annualized thats around 20-40%.
Now if the stock drops and I get assigned, turn around and start selling calls at a similar % range.

Downsides I see are: limiting your gains by being forced to sell a stock that goes on a big run, owning a stock that continues dropping (thereby decreasing the future options value) and capital gains tax on the option premiums.

,investing,"Hi All,
Newbie here trying to learn. Apologies to mods if this post is inappropriate, PM me and I'll delete it.

I was recently looking into the QR for AAGB and wanted to calculate the price to book value for my own learning.
I have linked the QR if anyone is interested in having a look
https://ir.airasia.com/misc/quarterly_report_20200630.pdf

To my understanding book value is total assets - total liabilities. Which in this QR's case gave us a value of RM 29,825,000 (page 4).

Outstanding share quantity is listed as 3,341,974,000 (page 29).

Current AAGB share price is listed as RM0.59 (online)

Using the formula P/B = Share price/ Book value per share.
I had 0.59/ (29,825,000/3,341,974,000) = 66

Yet on Bloomberg the P/B ratio is listed at 0.975.

This baffled me until I noted the column ""Net assets per share attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company (RM)"" with a listed value of RM 0.61.
By dividing share price (0.59) by this value (0.61) I was able to get a figure (0.967) that matched Bloomberg's.


My question today is twofold
1.)  Am I understanding the P/B formula incorrectly? How is asset value per share different to book value per share?

2.) Page 4 lists the following values

Previous quarter's total equity: RM2,910,740,000 

Previous quarter's asset value per share of 1.35 

Current quarter's total equity: RM29,825,000

Current quarter's asset value per share of 0.61

My question is how despite an equity decrease of roughly a factor of 100 was the asset value per share only halved between the 2 QRs?

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week, which could heighten fears the COVID-19 pandemic was inflicting lasting damage to the labor market.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 898,000 for the week ended Oct 10, compared to 845,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 825,000 applications in the latest week.

The weak labor market and resulting economic hardship are major hurdles to President Donald Trump’s chances of getting a second term in the White House when Americans go to the polls on Nov. 3. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic Party’s candidate, has blamed the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus crisis for the worst economy in at least 73 years.

Seven months into the pandemic in the United States, claims remain well above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though below a record 6.867 million in March. About 3.8 million people had permanently lost their jobs in September, with another 2.4 million unemployed for more than six months.

With the White House and Congress struggling to agree on another rescue package for businesses and the unemployed, claims are likely to remain elevated. Tens of thousands of airline workers have been furloughed. State and local government budgets have been crashed by the pandemic leading to layoffs that are expected to escalate without help from the federal government.

High unemployment and a resurgence in new coronavirus cases across the United States threaten the economy’s recovery from a recession, which started in February.

Though economic activity rebounded in the third quarter because of fiscal stimulus, the stubbornly high jobless claims suggest momentum ebbed heading into the fourth quarter.

Third-quarter GDP growth estimates are topping a 32% annualized rate. The economy contracted at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest decline since the government started keeping records in 1947.

Highlights:

* Net income: $4.9B (+40% from Q2, -15% YOY), net revenue: $20.3B (-9% from Q2, -11% YOY)
* Actual earnings/share: $0.51 (beats analysts est. $0.44)
* Interest-driven income is down (-17%), as is non-interest income (-4%)

Report says non-interest income is a mixed bag from contributing revenue streams. Consumer fees are down, but results of trading and investment banking are up.

Business loan and lease balances are up (+3%), as are deposits (+23%). Business/loans leases balances are at $950B, while consumer balances are at $1.7T.

CET1 value is at $173.2B (ratio of 11.9% vs. required 9.5%).

Other thoughts:

* BoA derives less nominal income from all sectors that I was interested in (consumer and commercial banking, investment banking and wealth management). I suppose this would be expected from a 'smaller' bank.

* Marginally less of BoA's total revenue comes from consumer banking (40%) compared to JPM (42%). This was actually contrary to the heuristic I had previously used.

I want to do some more reading before commenting on the state of commercial and investment banking, wealth management, and other revenue streams beyond their self-provided highlights. They use some slightly different terminology (e.g. I think BoA's ""global banking"" is synonymous with JPM's ""commercial banking"", but I want to do some more research to make sure).

Let’s say stock xyz: 

current stock price: $25 

option: $15 Call exp 10/23 
price paid for contract: $320 ($3.20 premium)
current contract price: $920 ($9.20 premium) 

So if I wanted to own 100 shares of this stock, I would exercise the contract, but what I don’t understand is what happens to the $9.20 premium? would it just disappear? or would it be subtracted from the $1500 that was paid? And if that were the case, could I potentially wait until the premium is $15.00 and get the 100 shares for $0 essentially? So sorry if the last question is kinda stupid, I have never encountered the situation of actually buying the shares from the contract, I usually just sell the call option I bought for premium profit.

&lt;p&gt;current stock price: $25 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;option: $15 Call exp 10/23 
price paid for contract: $320 ($3.20 premium)
current contract price: $920 ($9.20 premium) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if I wanted to own 100 shares of this stock, I would exercise the contract, but what I don’t understand is what happens to the $9.20 premium? would it just disappear? or would it be subtracted from the $1500 that was paid? And if that were the case, could I potentially wait until the premium is $15.00 and get the 100 shares for $0 essentially? So sorry if the last question is kinda stupid, I have never encountered the situation of actually buying the shares from the contract, I usually just sell the call option I bought for premium profit. Thanks in advance&lt;/p&gt;

NEW YORK—The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Center for Microeconomic Data released the September 2020 Survey of Consumer Expectations, which shows improvements in labor market and spending expectations, as well as less pessimistic views about households’ expected financial situation. Home price growth expectations returned to their pre-COVID-19 levels, and debt delinquency expectations remained low. In contrast, year-ahead household income expectations remain weak compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Median inflation expectations remained unchanged at the short-term horizon, while it declined at the medium-term horizon. Uncertainty and disagreement about future inflation remain elevated.
 
The main findings from the September 2020 Survey are:
 
**Inflation**


-	Median inflation expectations in September remained unchanged at 3.0% at the one-year horizon and decreased 0.3 percentage point returning to its July level of 2.7% at the three-year horizon. The decline was driven by respondents above the age of 40 and those with at least some college education. Our measure of disagreement across respondents (the difference between the 75th and 25th percentile of inflation expectations) remains substantially above its pre-COVID-19 levels at both horizons.


-	Median inflation uncertainty—or the uncertainty expressed regarding future inflation outcomes—increased for the third consecutive month at the three-year horizon, while it retreated to its July 2020 level at the one-year horizon. Both series remain elevated relative to their pre-COVID-19 readings.


-	Median home price change expectations continued on its upward trend after reaching a series’ low of 0% in April 2020, and increasing from 2.8% in August to 3.1% in September, just above its 2019 average of 3.0%. The increase was broad-based across demographic groups and was strongest for respondents who live in the South Census region.


-	The median one-year ahead expected change in the cost of a college education remained essentially unchanged, while median expectations for the price of gasoline and for food prices both declined by 0.8 and 0.3 percentage points to 4.8% and 5.1%, respectively. Median expectations for the cost of rent and medical care also decreased from 5.5% and 8.3% to 5.4% and 6.8% in September, respectively.
          
**Labor Market**

-	Median one-year ahead expected earnings growth remained unchanged at 2.0% in September, for the second consecutive month. The series is below its 2019 average level of 2.4%.


-	Mean unemployment expectations—or the mean probability that the U.S. unemployment rate will be higher one year from now—decreased from 39.1% in August, to 36.4% in September, below its 2019 average of 36.9%. The decline was driven by respondents below the age of 60.


-	The mean perceived probability of losing one’s job in the next 12 months retreated from 18.0% in August to 16.6% in September, remaining well above its pre-COVID-19 reading of 13.8% in February. This month’s decline was more pronounced among respondents above age 60 and those with a household income below $50,000. The mean probability of leaving one’s job voluntarily in the next 12 months increased 0.6 percentage point to 20.3% in September. The increase was broad-based across demographic groups.

-	The mean perceived probability of finding a job (if one’s current job was lost) declined from 50.7% in August to 49.9% in September. The series remains well below its 2019 average of 59.9%.
 
**Household Finance**


-	Median expected household income growth increased by 0.1 percentage point to 2.3% in September, remaining well below its 2019 average of 2.8%. The increase was driven mostly by respondents below the age of 40 and those with at least some college education.


-	Median household spending growth expectations increased from 3.0% in August to 3.4% in September, its highest reading since May 2019.

-	Perceptions of credit access compared to a year ago and expectations for year-ahead credit availability both improved somewhat in September, with fewer respondents reporting or expecting difficulties in obtaining credit.

-	The average perceived probability of missing a minimum debt payment over the next three months increased from 9.7% in August to 10.7% in September. This reading remains below its 2019 average of 11.5%.

-	The median expectation regarding a year-ahead change in taxes (at current income level) rebounded from 2.7% in August to 3.0% in September.

-	The mean perceived probability that the average interest rate on saving accounts will be higher 12 months from now slightly declined to 27.6% in September, from 28.0% in August.

-	Perceptions about households’ current financial situations compared to a year ago deteriorated slightly, with slightly more respondents reporting being worse off. In contrast, one-year ahead expectations about households’ financial situations improved with more respondents expecting their financial situation to improve and fewer respondents expecting their financial situation to worsen.

-	The mean perceived probability that U.S. stock prices will be higher 12 months from now decreased 0.8 percentage points to 44.1% in September.
 
About the Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE)

The SCE contains information about how consumers expect overall inflation and prices for food, gas, housing, and education to behave. It also provides insight into Americans’ views about job prospects and earnings growth and their expectations about future spending and access to credit. The SCE also provides measures of uncertainty regarding consumers’ outlooks. Expectations are also available by age, geography, income, education, and numeracy. 
 
The SCE is a nationally representative, internet-based survey of a rotating panel of approximately 1,300 household heads. Respondents participate in the panel for up to 12 months, with a roughly equal number rotating in and out of the panel each month. Unlike comparable surveys based on repeated cross-sections with a different set of respondents in each wave, our panel allows us to observe the changes in expectations and behavior of the same individuals over time.",t2_p8vmm,False,,0,False,Consumers’ Labor Market and Spending Expectations Improve,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jbeja9,False,dark,0.72,,public,10,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,10,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1602755595.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce""&gt;https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK—The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Center for Microeconomic Data released the September 2020 Survey of Consumer Expectations, which shows improvements in labor market and spending expectations, as well as less pessimistic views about households’ expected financial situation. Home price growth expectations returned to their pre-COVID-19 levels, and debt delinquency expectations remained low. In contrast, year-ahead household income expectations remain weak compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Median inflation expectations remained unchanged at the short-term horizon, while it declined at the medium-term horizon.

,investing,"NET and AKAM dropping on the FSLY revenue news is crazy in my view and a buying opportunity. [The huge spike of fake fancy bear DDoS extortion attacks](https://securityboulevard.com/2020/09/major-global-ransom-denial-of-service-campaign-continues-rising-trend-in-global-ddos-attacks/) is going to be a revenue and earnings driver for both companies. The levels of DDoS attacks happening around the world right now is simply unprecedented and driving companies to adopt DDoS mitigation services at rates never seen before.  In the security industry we are calling this DDoS extortion campaign the 3rd pandemic along with COVID and Ransomware. 

The [FBI](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-thousands-of-orgs-targeted-by-rdos-extortion-campaign/amp/) is saying THOUSANDS of organizations have been hit since mid August. These companies are being driven into the arms of AKAM and NET to avoid extortion demands of 20-30 BTC.  Depending on the provider and the customer characteristics, these contracts will have a $50-$200K one time emergency set up fee and monthly recurring charges between $5K-$50K based on the bandwidth the website or the network consumes.  It’s also worth mentioning that [OFAC warned on October 1st](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.natlawreview.com/article/ofac-advisory-warns-civil-penalties-ransomware-payments%3famp) that companies who pay ransoms to sanctioned entities may face civil liabilities making it SUPER risky for a company to pay an extortion demand. 

AKAM is the gold standard for critical firms like Financial Services and was [engaged](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/nzx-shifts-to-akamai-says-trading-continues-despite-site-being-down-again/6PRQ5W7SAMXA5Z5FKVRTQCSIXI/) when NZX Stock Exchange was hit in August. Their prices are high, but top tier firms are willing to pay. AKAM should be able to take a significant amount of the high end of the market. They have maintained market share and grown despite new entrants to the CDN market. Their Kona  platform is hugely capable at wrapping security and DDoS mitigation services around CDN. Their Prolexic Scrubbing Centers offer some of the industry’s best network layer DDoS mitigation (Prolexic was best in class at this in 2014 when they were acquired by AKAM and only got better with scale).  

NET stands to massively benefit from this spike in DDoS attacks as well. Their “freemium” business model is designed for events like this. In a [recent investor presentation ](https://cloudflare.net/files/doc_downloads/Presentations/2020/q2/Cloudflare-Q2-2020-Investor-Presentation_FINAL.pdf) they discuss how they invert the typical marketing approach and rely on customers to “pull” them into new services and markets. This is the type of storm them have been waiting for. Their CDN and “Spectrum” application layer DDoS mitigation services give AKAM a run for their money and their network/BGP layer “Magic Transit” services are innovative and disruptive.  The current “fake fancy bear” attacks will likely drive significant Magic Transit revenue because these attacks are aimed at the network layer.  The beautiful thing here is the cost of this revenue is almost nothing because of their demand/pull business model and the fact that Magic Transit capacity is only utilized during an active attack. In other words, NET can put massive numbers of customers on the Magic Transit platform and not consume additional resources.  NET is also small enough that doubling or tripling security services revenue will have a big impact on the overall P&amp;L. 

To put the scale of these attacks in perspective, I’ve talked to engineers at one of the largest and most respected domain registrars. In many cases if you want to enable DDoS mitigation services you must modify your domain registration record to point to a new set of DNS servers. This change is usually a quick phone call and takes 5-10 minutes. This domain registrar said they have been making DNS server changes for companies that needed DDoS mitigation services 24x7.... for 5 weeks straight!!!  They said it’s been unlike anything they have ever seen.   While this is an indirect indicator, I believe it’s a pretty good proxy of demand happening over at AKAM and NET and is the reason I went long on both recently.

,investing,"Hey there

Sustainable investment is a big trend in the financial industry. Considerable amounts are somewhat ESG managed and the trend goes on. 
I was just wondering about the sustainability impact of ESG optimisation at the capital markets. 

Many ESG investment products exclude companies with ESG controversies or select for more sustainable companies.
If the price of a stock falls because investors fancy companies with better ESG exposure that would merely create arbitrage opportunities for anyone else.
How does excluding the unsustainable companies from a portfolio create an impact on their business operations? 
 
I understand that some consider ESG as a risk identification framework to predict declines of future returns due to unsustainable operations. This, however, is a different motivation than those who try to make the world a better place by ""reducing the co2 footprint of their portfolio"" or ""aligning their investments with their values"". 

I see possibilities for impact in shareholder engagement. shareholders can request the management to make their operations more sustainable to a certain extent. That, however, requires the investors not to disinvest from unsustainable companies. Otherwise I would advise an investor who wants to provide capital for sustainable value creation to invest in delisted companies. 

What part am I missing?

,investing,"Hi. I'm a high schooler (16), and I started investing in the stock market about 6 months ago. 

I recently gained great interest in VR stocks, and I believe it has a huge potential to become a much larger market than it currently is. I'm sure that millions of others also noticed this potential, but I haven't seen much discussion going up anywhere. 

Why I think Virtual Reality would rise rapidly:

1) Covid-19 has forced us to transition offline events to online ones- and during the process, we learned that online learning &amp; working environments are not horrible but perhaps even beneficial. Several companies (especially tech) reported an increase in productivity after moving into online working environments. 

Many employees and students will continue to learn from home even after the pandemic ends, which opens new VR opportunities. Facebook announced their Occulus Quest 2 VR headsets yesterday and their VR office software 'Infinite Office' a few weeks ago. VR usage in workplaces and school will skyrocket once the technology becomes more mature and cheaper. 

2) It's a new thing to sell for Apple and Samsung. Phones of yesteryear have no noticeable differences than phones of this year, and this has been a struggle for companies that rely on consumers buying $1000 devices every two years or so. 

Companies like Apple desperately need a new 'platform' to sell- and I think VR will serve that role. All relevant tech companies have patents on VR technology, and there are rumors of Apple VR in 2021.

3) Entertainment. Not only video games, but concerts, art, museums, plays, and perhaps even travel. VR gaming is a hot topic, but I think VR can open new opportunities for other entertainment forms. Some museums have already uploaded the VR environments of their exhibitions. BTS recently held their online concert two days ago and had over 1 million viewers. I believe VR concerts may overtake offline ones in the next several years. 

But one concern I have is that the tech market seems to be in a bubble right now. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like there are several large bubbles that, when burst, could bring the whole market down. 

I feel that VR's success is a proven fact at this point, but I'm worried that I would suffer large losses throughout the next years if the bubble were to burst.

Japanese conglomerate SoftBank has been looking for someone to acquire its semiconductor designer Arm and although it finally settled on NVIDIA, that deal may still fall through at least in one country. The UK government is reportedly preparing to intervene and block the acquisition if necessary on the grounds that NVIDIA buying up Arm could not only endanger its citizens’ jobs but also threaten the country’s sovereignty over one of its very few technology champions.

Cambridge-based Arm, formerly ARM Holdings, was an independent company until it was acquired by Japan’s SoftBank Group just last 2016. Arm, the owner and designer of the world’s most used processor technology for mobile and embedded computing, was able to retain its original business model and operations under SoftBank’s ownership. There are, however, concerns that things might not be the same with NVIDIA holding the reins.

[The UK is particularly concerned](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-8824785/UK-edges-closer-blocking-30bn-sale-UK-chip-maker-Arm-Nvidia.html) about the effects the acquisition would have on the country’s economy and sovereignty. As a UK-based company, Arm is naturally one of the country’s prized possessions and it won’t simply allow it to be handed over without much scrutiny.

NVIDIA, of course, has promised to keep the status quo as far as Arm’s business model is concerned. It even committed to turning the UK into a global center for AI research and excellence which could help strengthen the country’s economy and prestige. Some UK officials, however, are not buying it at face value.

NVIDIA’s acquisition of Arm could face similar scrutiny from other regulators in the US and EU as it would give NVIDIA a competitive edge over its rivals. The potential for taking advantage of that to the detriment of rivaling Arm customers is too great to ignore. The deal is valued at $40 billion or 30 billion GBP.

,investing,"TL;DR: I ran a series late-bubble scenarios playing out for different investor temperaments and behaviors and and ranked them.

Net result is that cost-averaging \[correction: I mean investing part of your earnings every month, not averaging-in a lump sum\] is probably best you can do unless you have near-perfect timing, but the temptation to timing remains when one smells a bubble.

**Context:**

To me we're obviously in a tech-driven stock bubble... strong positive feedback on prices, massive increase in casual trading, new-era stories about the COVID winners, outright frauds being blown up by Hindenburg... while market as a whole has shot way past earnings and economic activity.

For my temperament, buying now is out of the question, but I'm struggling with just how much to stay in the market.

Many will obviously say that you can't time the market, but I find (a) I'm tempted to take what gains have happened so far, and (b) I'm scared of the next pop and potential ""lost years"" waiting for markets to recover.

**I'm not looking for your advice on what to do**, but rather feedback on realism of the following investor scenario or any scenarios you would add.

**#1: Buys Near Bottom, Sells Near Peak**

AKA ""For timing the market you have to be right twice, once to buy and once to sell"" (if already invested: right once to sell, then again to re-buy)

Temperament: value investor, immune to fear, FOMO, greed.

This investor has ""dry powder"" and snaps up crash bargains below fair value, then holds onto them through the bubble, sells off to build up cash position when approaching peak bubble.

Investor is probably already rich to have the cash-on-hand and has a sense of security and temperament gives them detachment from the bubble optimism and crash pessimism... and some luck to not overshoot the peak or buy too early/late in the crash.

This investor is however likely to miss out on companies with break-out growth, due to emphasis on value.

With peak 100 and crash to 60: buys in at 40, sells at 90, buys in again at 65 post-crash.

*This investor makes roughly market return through the boom... but skips the loss of the crash.*

**#2: Cost-Averaged Time In The Market**

AKA ""Time in the market beats timing the market""

Temperament: lazy, doesn't want to worry about the market.

Behavior: This investor buys a bit every month from their salary, with a long horizon to retirement.

Buys at all stages: early boom (50), late boom (80), top of market (100), bottom of market (60), early recovery (70), late recovery (90)

*This investor makes the market return, cost-averaged. Not quite ""lump sum invested in 1980"" return, but decent nonetheless.*

**#3: Sells Slightly Early Pre-Peak, Buys Slightly Late Post-Bottom**

AKA ""Sell early, buy late""  / ""Buy late, sell early""

Temperament: value investor with fears of overpricing, but lacking optimism after a crash

This investor buys during a run up (avoids FOMO/regret), then gets fearful of late bubble overpricing and reduces holdings. The market then sees further gains for several months to a year before crashing.

Soon after the crash the investor sees better value, and starts to shift back into stocks, but is late for the early phase of a quick recovery.

With peak 100 and crash to 60: buys in during 40-80 boom, sells at 80, misses 80-100 climb, misses 100-60 crash, misses 60-80 recovery, and buys back at 80 for next boom.

*At best they do similar to time-in-the-market investor by missing late-bubble and early-recovery gains negated the benefits of skipping the crash.*

**#4: Sells Slightly Early Pre-Peak, Buys Slightly Early Pre-Bottom**

Temperament: value investor with fear of overpricing, but overly-optimistic after a decline

Behavior: This investor buys during run-up, then gets fearful late bubble and reduces holdings, missing the late-bubble gains. Soon after the crash the investor sees better value, and increases holdings... during a 2-year year declining market.

With peak 100 and crash to 60: buys in during 40-80 boom, sells at 80, misses 80-100 climb, misses 100-80 crash, buys at 80, sees 80-60 decline, sees slow climb back to 80 new boom.

*This investor does similarly to the previous one if they end up buy into the  crash at the same level as #3 buys in post-crash.*

**#5: Buys at Peak and Holds**

Temperament:  FOMO investor that waits until others have made gains, with strong new-era belief

This investor buys near/at the peak due to FOMO and new-era optimism, and intends to hold no matter what.

Bubble pops but investor holds on through the decline, waiting patiently for 3-10 years to attain a new high.

With peak 100 and crash to 60: buys in late at 90, sees climb to 100, sees crash to 60, waits for years as it climbs back to 90.

*This investor sees several ""lost years"" while real corporate earnings gradually catch up to the high expectations of the bubble.*

**#6: Buys at Peak, Sells at Bottom**

Temperament:  FOMO investor that waits until others have made gains, with weak new-era belief

This investor stays out early, buys late in boom out of FOMO / regret / new-era optimism, sells out of despair at worst of the bust, re-buys out of hope once recovery is obvious.

May even have recognized the bubble and intended to get out just before the crash (like #4), but holds too long due and sells at the bottom.

With peak 100 and crash to 60: buys in late at 90, sees climb to 100, sells after crash at 60, buys again after climb to 80.

&lt;p&gt;With peak 100 and crash to 60: buys in late at 90, sees climb to 100, sees crash to 60, waits for years as it climbs back to 90.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This investor sees several &amp;quot;lost years&amp;quot; while real corporate earnings gradually catch up to the high expectations of the bubble.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temperament:  FOMO investor that waits until others have made gains, with weak new-era belief&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This investor stays out early, buys late in boom out of FOMO / regret / new-era optimism, sells out of despair at worst of the bust, re-buys out of hope once recovery is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May even have recognized the bubble and intended to get out just before the crash (like #4), but holds too long due and sells at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With peak 100 and crash to 60: buys in late at 90, sees climb to 100, sells after crash at 60, buys again after climb to 80.&lt;/p&gt;

JP Morgan analysts led by Nick Lai raised their price target on NIO sharply to $40 in a report released on Wednesday.


NIO shares closed at $21.62 on Tuesday, and JP Morgan's price target means NIO has 85% upside potential.

NIO shares went up by more than 7 percent in pre-market trading on Wednesday.


JP Morgan sharply raises NIO price target to $40, representing 85% upside potential-cnTechPost


JP Morgan's last rating on NIO was Neutral and was made on June 21, when the price target was $14.

In its latest report, JP Morgan gave NIO an Overweight rating and admitted that ""we missed the stock's major rally YTD.""

The report said Nio remains attractive from a long term perspective.

We are upgrading the stock to OW from Neutral and set a new Jun-21 PT of USD40 based on 3.0x 2025E EV to sales.

Admittedly, we missed the stock's major rally YTD. Instead of trying to justify a higher PT, we review our long term investment thesis based on our bullish top-down sector view, introduce 2025 earnings projection and draw implication to the current stock price.

We come to the conclusion that Nio remains attractive from a long term perspective.

We project the company to earn a ~7% market share in passenger EV market by 2025 or specifically ~30% share in the premium space which Nio focuses on.

In the near term, key catalysts would include:

1) anticipated solid 3Q results in mid-November, where we forecast GPM to further expand to ~12% vs. 8% in 2Q20.

2) Robust order backlog, in particular, the newly launched EC6 crossover model for which the wait time is around eight weeks due to initial productionramp and very strong demand.

3) A new sedan model scheduled to debut on ""Nio Day"" in December which should further enhance the company's current product portfolio (of two SUVs - ES8 and ES6, and one crossover - EC6).

Following the introduction of our 2023-25 earnings forecasts, we lift our Jun-21 PT to USD40 based on 3.0x EV to 2025E sales, the same valuation approach (of 3.0x EV to 2025E sales) we apply to Xpeng Auto, another Chinese EV start-up.

This also presents a meaningful discount to Tesla's current 5.1x EV to 2025E sales, which we believe is reasonable considering Tesla's technology leadership globally and market share momentum especially in China.

Previously, we followed average of three approaches in Nio's valuation analysis including EV/sales, PER and EV/EBITDA, which gives us a PT of USD36.

Considering consistency of valuation methodology across EV OEMs under coverage, we now move Nio's approach to EV/sales.

Investment Thesis, Valuation and Risks

NIO Inc. (Overweight; Price Target: $40.00)

Opportunities in 2021:

(1) Rising NEV penetration with an emerging and structural shift from ""B"" to ""C"" – with Tesla's localized Model 3 and aggressive pricing; we see an increasing (and unexpected) trend where more EV buyers are individuals, rather than corporates or individuals living in cities with purchase quotas – this structural wave could broaden EVs' addressable market, but lead to faster concentration in the EV business; NIO could benefit as long as it stays within the top 10 by market share.

(2) The extension of the NEV subsidy program toward 2022, where the battery swap business model is covered by the government's subsidy scheme, is encouraging.

(3) We project a meaningful pickup in new model launches, especially in 4Q20, along with the new model, EC6. The new sedan model is scheduled to debut on ""Nio Day"" in December which should further enhance the company's current product portfolio (of two SUVs- ES8 and ES6 and one crossover- EC6).

Downside risks include:

Worse-than-expected execution and delivery of vehicles;

Worse-than-expected overall auto market sales/EV demand; and worse-than-expected competition from rivals with products at similar price points.

&gt;Consider a portfolio with a target allocation of 5% bitcoin. If bitcoin’s allocation rises to 10% of the portfolio due to its outperformance relative to other assets, a disciplined rebalancing strategy would dictate selling bitcoin to bring its allocation back to the 5% target and using the funds to increase the allocation to other asset classes, which have drifted below their target allocation. If bitcoin underperforms and declines to 1% of the portfolio, investors would buy bitcoin and sell their position in other asset classes that are above their target allocation.

Apple Inc. AAPL -2.65% unveiled a new iPhone Tuesday capable of connecting to a much faster 5G cellular network, which investors are betting will spur strong demand.

Chief Executive Tim Cook stood at the company’s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters to begin the webcast, streamed on Apple’s website—a visual reminder of how the tech giant’s latest flagship-product introduction differs from previous ones because of the coronavirus pandemic, which closed businesses and left people sheltering at home around the world for much of this year.

The iPhone 12 offered a new physical appearance from last year’s smartphone, moving from a rounded design to a flatter-edged look reminiscent of the iPhone 4. Apple revealed four versions of the phones ranging in sizes and starting in price from $699 for the iPhone 12 Mini with a 5.4-inch display. The iPhone 12 Pro Max has a 6.7-inch display, an increase from 6.5 inches; the higher-end versions emphasize the camera abilities.

The greatest hype going into the event, however, has been about the device’s 5G capability. Apple’s adoption of the next-generation wireless standard places intense focus on the new technology that has been years in the making. Cellular network carriers have been scrambling to roll out 5G service across the U.S., but coverage remains spotty in the country and it isn’t clear yet whether customers will want it.

“Today is the beginning of a new era for iPhone,” Mr. Cook said.

Shares slipped as the event took place, which has occurred with previous Apple events, before rebounding. With few people familiar with the new cellular service, Mr. Cook made an effort to describe why 5G technology would improve their experience. He cited improved downloads and uploads, higher-quality video streaming, better gaming and less network congestion. Apple also highlighted the integration with the company’s new A14 Bionic microchip.

The presentation included demonstrations of how 5G iPhones could be helpful in downloading important medical images and for remotely designing factory spaces—tacit acknowledgments that some of the most likely customers for the technology might be business users who can benefit from faster connections.

“Apple almost provides like the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval,” Mark Vena, a senior analyst for Moor Insights &amp; Strategy said. “They tend to validate the technology, which is unfair because you could go out today and buy a Samsung phone” with 5G.

The emphasis on the guts of the iPhone marked a change from recent years where many new features involved cameras and other iterative updates. The lack of dramatic change has come as the smartphone market has matured more than a decade after Apple first introduced the iPhone.

The latest smartphone arrives five years after iPhone unit sales peaked. Mr. Cook has pushed the company to sell pricier versions of the device and to rely on software services and wearables, such as smartwatches and headphones, to boost revenue.

In a nod to those efforts, the company began its Tuesday event by introducing an updated HomePod that is smaller than its previous version of the speaker and is priced at $99.

Apple began selling the HomePod in early 2018 after unspecified delays pushed back the rollout following its 2017 debut. The voice-activated device was Apple’s attempt to catch up with the success of Amazon.com Inc. and its smart speakers in late 2014, though when the HomePod debuted at $349 it was considerably more expensive than its rivals.

To make the case for a pricier offering, Apple has previously emphasized its sound quality, especially when it comes to music. The device’s price has fallen since it first went on the market.

The iPhone 12 has been hotly anticipated by investors who have driven up the company’s shares 69% in 2020, partly because of excitement over the new phone. Those expectations and Apple’s success in driving up services revenue helped it become the first U.S. public company to eclipse $2 trillion in market value earlier this year.

Analysts surveyed by FactSet, on average, predict iPhone revenue will rise 15% to $160 billion in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. That is about $6 billion shy of the record set in fiscal 2018, when the $1,000 iPhone X helped bolster sales even as shipments failed to reach a new high.

Katy Huberty, a veteran Apple analyst for Morgan Stanley, last week predicted the company could ship as many as 240 million iPhones this year, helped by customers who haven’t upgraded in several years and excitement for 5G. That would set a record, beating the 231 million devices sold in fiscal 2015. Sales at that level could send the company’s shares up 37% from Monday’s close to a market value of almost $2.9 trillion, she said.

“We expect this fall’s launch to be the most significant iPhone event in years,” she wrote in a note to investors.

What new products or updates are you hoping to see from Apple? Join the conversation below.

In recent years, Mr. Cook has been stretching the iPhone lineup to appeal to an array of pocketbooks. That was on display again Tuesday: A step up from the iPhone 12 Mini sits the iPhone 12, starting at $799 with a 6.1-inch display. On the higher end, the iPhone 12 Pro starts at $999, with the Pro Max offering the largest display and beginning at $1,099.

The iPhone 12 and 12 Pro are available for pre-order on Friday, and the iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max will be available Nov. 6, Apple said.

Some analysts are skeptical that customers will flock to a 5G phone without a must-have application or service to help them see the appeal of the new technology. U.S. cellular networks are still being upgraded, and service might be disappointing in some spots for early adopters.

It is also uncertain how the coronavirus will affect sales of the new devices. The pandemic delayed production of the flagship phone earlier this year, which led Tuesday’s unveiling to be rescheduled from its traditional September date.

Mr. Cook appeared publicly for the first time since a Democratic-led House subcommittee last week issued a report claiming Apple uses its control over software on its devices in an anticompetitive manner.

,investing,"Hi all -- I'm did an NPV at my old job, and my current class is making me rethink how we did it. It's really been bugging me! The background, without giving anything away, is that we were establishing the NPV of buying a division of another company using all debt. The plan was be to sell the division in 5 years, and the division consisted of a factory (PP&amp;E) along with some NWC items (mostly inventory).

1. Would you use the cost of debt as your discount rate instead of WACC? I'd use WACC to value the division intrinsicly, yes, but since we're looking at the NPV, the discount rate should be our actual cost of capital utilized to finance the project, no? And in this case that capital is 100% debt. Or would we still use WACC and assume a target capital structure in the calculation of that WACC?
2. If we sold the division in 5 years my thinking is that we would only tax the amount above the book value basis. (In other words, say we sold for exactly the book value - there would be no taxes, right?)
3. If we used the APV method to value this because there isn't a consistent capital structure, would we value the tax shield beyond the sale date? I don't think so because you'd assume you no longer would hold the debt after the sale. So you'd have 0 terminal value for the debt shield in 5 years and assume that the PVTS is just the 5 years of the tax shield when you did own the division
4. For any other projects that we spun up while owning the division that we financed with case, should the discount rate utilized be the cost of equity? For example, if we though buying a new machine could reduce costs, we'd project the incremental cash flows and discount at the cost of equity, no?
5. If this is all correct, connecting this all back to public equities, they maket would look at the intrinsic value of the company (i.e. they'd use WACC in point #1) and add it to the market cap. And, if done correctly, the NPV should be the same as the increase in market cap that comes from the intrinsic valuation done by the market because the sale price in 5 years would be captured in the terminal value of the division?

Thanks for helping me think through some of these!

,investing,"I usually don't post my trade ideas, but giving this a shot..

Over the last week, I've built myself a position/4 month lottery ticket of 19:1 odds minimum.This post is NOT to encourage others to copy that, but to share my thinking behind it and hope to hear interesting critiques. I may lose all my premium in this position, but its a risk I'm willing to take. As a degen and given my perception of the odds, I gotta do what I gotta do.

The trade is long $CTSO call options and stocks. The post has 3 sections -

1. thesis (as concise as I could make it);
2. bet/trade structure;
3. significant risks/further reading;

**Thesis:**

* *About:* Cytosorbents ($CTSO) is a biotech company focusing on blood-purification via blood filters (cytosorbs) mainly for use in cardiac surgery patients, but also in other critically-ill patients.
* *Summary Financials:* $CTSO trades at an enterprise value(EV) of $280mm/mkt cap of $350mm. They've been growing at 60% yoy growth, with current annual revenues at $30mm, cash-on-hand of $90mm and annualized cash burn of $5m.
* *Current WS consensus:* Consensus stock price from wall street analysts is $15 (but who listens to them)
* *Primary catalyst:* The firm got breakthrough FDA designation to remove ticagrelor in cardiac surgery patients in Apr 2020, and the bet is on them getting full approval over the next few months. They already have EU approval for this, and FDA approval will open US markets and increase the total addressable market (TAM) by anywhere between $250million to $1.5billion per year. REMOVE trial results are expected in second half 2020 (topline results expected anytime now as trial is complete), and a positive result should confirm the path to FDA approval.
* *Secondary catalysts:* Not counting on these, but good to have:
   * earnings outperformance (low expectations currently in spite of growth trajectory) - company delivered 60% yoy growth in Q1 and Q2 despite elective surgeries having a slowdown in Q2 (deficit made up by COVID use) and became commercially available in Latin countries in June.
   * Biotech sector RV convergence: I notice many biotechs trade on hope and having market cap of $1-2bn, even without any product approval/manufacturing in place. Here's a company growing at 60%, with a product that has been used &gt;100k times across multiple indications with positive results, and has EU approval but trading at such discounted levels. Think its missing a flagship/activist investor who could serve as a microphone for the company.
   * EUA (emergency use authorization) for use in severe COVID patients getting extended/broadened;
   * Accelerated progress in their HemoDefend product (universal plasma transfer technology that removes restriction on A/B/AB/O donor vs. recipient matching): DoD granted \~$5mm in grants this year - $1mm on Friday itself;
   * BigPharma acquisition or collaboration
* *Conservative Valuation:* Given positive REMOVE results and hence FDA approval, we assume incremental $500mm TAM (lower end of $0.25-$1.5bn), I expect stock to be at $25 minimum
   * TAM of $500mm x 0.2 market share = $100mm revenues additional -&gt; $130mm per year
   * 75% gross profit margin = $100mm gross profit;
   * 2x S&amp;A expenses of $40mm and constant R&amp;D expenses of $10mm = $50mio EBIT
   * EV/EBIT of 20 = $1bn valuation = approx. $25 stock price
   * If market sees it as incremental TAM of $1.5bn, the stock should do 7x minimum. Further, the approval could be seen as validation for the company and their role in critical care management, and potentially unlocks usage for broader indications (as this is a broad spectrum therapeutic), and bigpharma collaborations.

**Bet:**

**I am long 330 (x100) call options at strike $15 for 19Feb21**. I bought them for approx. $0.5 per contract. If my view is realized, that should mean bet-payoff is 19:1 (i.e. $9.5 profit).

Is this a positive expected value (EV) bet? I don't know, but here's my subjective probabilities:

* Probability of getting FDA/REMOVE news by Feb = 1/3 (breakthrough designation 6 months ago so final approval in 10 months I hope)
* Probability that FDA news is approval = 1/2 (conservative given EU approval and FDA breakthrough approval already + given case results etc)
* Probability of FDA approval, hence = 1/6 (0.33 \* 0.5)

Expected value per option contract (x100) = 1/6 \* (+9.5) + 5/6 \* (-0.5) = $1.16 (x100). (If I regard probability is lower by 50%, it is still a positive EV bet of +$0.2)

Using Kelly's criterion, given the odds and payoffs, I should bet 12% of my bet stack. (If I regard probability is lower by 50% , I should bet 4% of my stack)

I've mitigated some of the risks by also buying some stock since that has no expiry limitations (probability of win = 1/3 since no expiry; bet-payoff with a stop at -50% = 6:1; Kelly's criterion: 22%; with 50% lower probability: 3%)

Kelly criterion is just a starting point, I further took into account how much I am comfortable losing and leaving some dry powder for a pull-back. To start with, I've decided to go with an investment of $17k in options right now, and &gt;$100k in stocks. I will upsize/downsize as I get more news, but that's the position for now.

I'm not willing to imagine what happens if market views it as an incremental $1.5bn TAM. (You're a voice in my head. No, you're a voice in mine. You're a fucking hallucination, why can't I get rid of you.)

**Significant Risks:**

* Biggest risk is price catalysts don't materialize.
* I don't have any Dollar Bill connections - so am I not not unsure, lol. (No FDA or CTSO contacts to be clear)
* Illiquid stock/option market and micro-cap risks
* 7% short float and 9 days to cover - is that sizeable for a short squeeze? I don't know

TL;DR, I think the stock is massively undervalued, given the potential for the company, the upcoming price catalysts, the successful track record against the backdrop of current stock valuations. My options bet has a conservative payoff of 19:1 if I get it right (possibly more), and if not, hopefully the stock moves &gt;20% to make up for the lost premium.

EDIT: For those interested to play this, think using stocks is probably better than options. Vol is quite high, and options markets are illiquid.

&lt;p&gt;Over the last week, I&amp;#39;ve built myself a position/4 month lottery ticket of 19:1 odds minimum.This post is NOT to encourage others to copy that, but to share my thinking behind it and hope to hear interesting critiques. I may lose all my premium in this position, but its a risk I&amp;#39;m willing to take. As a degen and given my perception of the odds, I gotta do what I gotta do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trade is long $CTSO call options and stocks. The post has 3 sections -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thesis (as concise as I could make it);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bet/trade structure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;significant risks/further reading;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thesis:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;About:&lt;/em&gt; Cytosorbents ($CTSO) is a biotech company focusing on blood-purification via blood filters (cytosorbs) mainly for use in cardiac surgery patients, but also in other critically-ill patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary Financials:&lt;/em&gt; $CTSO trades at an enterprise value(EV) of $280mm/mkt cap of $350mm. They&amp;#39;ve been growing at 60% yoy growth, with current annual revenues at $30mm, cash-on-hand of $90mm and annualized cash burn of $5m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current WS consensus:&lt;/em&gt; Consensus stock price from wall street analysts is $15 (but who listens to them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Primary catalyst:&lt;/em&gt; The firm got breakthrough FDA designation to remove ticagrelor in cardiac surgery patients in Apr 2020, and the bet is on them getting full approval over the next few months. They already have EU approval for this, and FDA approval will open US markets and increase the total addressable market (TAM) by anywhere between $250million to $1.5billion per year. REMOVE trial results are expected in second half 2020 (topline results expected anytime now as trial is complete), and a positive result should confirm the path to FDA approval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secondary catalysts:&lt;/em&gt; Not counting on these, but good to have:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;earnings outperformance (low expectations currently in spite of growth trajectory) - company delivered 60% yoy growth in Q1 and Q2 despite elective surgeries having a slowdown in Q2 (deficit made up by COVID use) and became commercially available in Latin countries in June.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biotech sector RV convergence: I notice many biotechs trade on hope and having market cap of $1-2bn, even without any product approval/manufacturing in place. Here&amp;#39;s a company growing at 60%, with a product that has been used &amp;gt;100k times across multiple indications with positive results, and has EU approval but trading at such discounted levels. Think its missing a flagship/activist investor who could serve as a microphone for the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EUA (emergency use authorization) for use in severe COVID patients getting extended/broadened;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accelerated progress in their HemoDefend product (universal plasma transfer technology that removes restriction on A/B/AB/O donor vs. recipient matching): DoD granted ~$5mm in grants this year - $1mm on Friday itself;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BigPharma acquisition or collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conservative Valuation:&lt;/em&gt; Given positive REMOVE results and hence FDA approval, we assume incremental $500mm TAM (lower end of $0.25-$1.5bn), I expect stock to be at $25 minimum

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TAM of $500mm x 0.2 market share = $100mm revenues additional -&amp;gt; $130mm per year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;75% gross profit margin = $100mm gross profit;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2x S&amp;amp;A expenses of $40mm and constant R&amp;amp;D expenses of $10mm = $50mio EBIT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EV/EBIT of 20 = $1bn valuation = approx. $25 stock price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If market sees it as incremental TAM of $1.5bn, the stock should do 7x minimum. Further, the approval could be seen as validation for the company and their role in critical care management, and potentially unlocks usage for broader indications (as this is a broad spectrum therapeutic), and bigpharma collaborations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bet:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am long 330 (x100) call options at strike $15 for 19Feb21&lt;/strong&gt;. I bought them for approx. $0.5 per contract. If my view is realized, that should mean bet-payoff is 19:1 (i.e. $9.5 profit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a positive expected value (EV) bet? I don&amp;#39;t know, but here&amp;#39;s my subjective probabilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probability of getting FDA/REMOVE news by Feb = 1/3 (breakthrough designation 6 months ago so final approval in 10 months I hope)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probability that FDA news is approval = 1/2 (conservative given EU approval and FDA breakthrough approval already + given case results etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probability of FDA approval, hence = 1/6 (0.33 * 0.5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expected value per option contract (x100) = 1/6 * (+9.5) + 5/6 * (-0.5) = $1.16 (x100). (If I regard probability is lower by 50%, it is still a positive EV bet of +$0.2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Kelly&amp;#39;s criterion, given the odds and payoffs, I should bet 12% of my bet stack. (If I regard probability is lower by 50% , I should bet 4% of my stack)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve mitigated some of the risks by also buying some stock since that has no expiry limitations (probability of win = 1/3 since no expiry; bet-payoff with a stop at -50% = 6:1; Kelly&amp;#39;s criterion: 22%; with 50% lower probability: 3%)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significant Risks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biggest risk is price catalysts don&amp;#39;t materialize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have any Dollar Bill connections - so am I not not unsure, lol. (No FDA or CTSO contacts to be clear)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illiquid stock/option market and micro-cap risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7% short float and 9 days to cover - is that sizeable for a short squeeze? I don&amp;#39;t know&lt;/li&gt;

,investing,"Disney is restructuring its media and entertainment divisions, as streaming becomes the most important facet of the company’s media business.

On Monday, the company revealed that in order to further accelerate its direct-to-consumer strategy, it would be centralizing its media businesses into a single organization that will be responsible for content distribution, ad sales and Disney+.

Shares of the company jumped more than 5% during after-hours trading following the announcement.

The move by Disney comes as the global coronavirus pandemic has crippled its theatrical business and ushered more customers toward its streaming options. As of August, Disney has 100 million paid subscribers across its streaming offerings, more than half of whom are subscribers to Disney+.

“I would not characterize it as a response to Covid,” CEO Bob Chapek told CNBC’s Julia Boorstin on “Closing Bell” on Monday. “I would say Covid accelerated the rate at which we made this transition, but this transition was going to happen anyway.”

“We are tilting the scale pretty dramatically [toward streaming],” Chapek said on “Closing Bell,” noting that the company is looking at all investments, **including dividends**, as it seeks to increase its spend on new content. Chapek said the board of directors will have the final say on Disney’s dividend payouts.

Only last week, activist investor Dan Loeb called on Chapek to end the company’s annual $3 billion dividend to divert more capital to new Disney+ content.

Loeb’s Third Point Capital is one of Disney’s largest shareholders and bought more shares earlier this year in support of Disney’s repositioning around Disney+, its flagship subscription streaming service.

Loeb told CNBC, “We are pleased to see that Disney is focused on the same opportunity that makes us such enthusiastic shareholders: investing heavily in the DTC business, positioning Disney to thrive in the next era of entertainment.”

Chapek said the reorganization could result in some reduction of staff, but not likely at the same scale as was seen at the company’s parks division last month. Disney was forced to lay off around 28,000 workers after it became clear that its Disneyland parks in California would not be reopening soon.

As part of this reorganization, Disney has promoted Kareem Daniel, the former president of consumer products, games and publishing. He will now oversee the new media and entertainment distribution group.

He’ll be in charge of making sure streaming becomes profitable, as the company continues to invest heavily in its various streaming products. Daniel will hold the reins to all of the company’s streaming services and domestic television networks, including all content distribution, sales and advertising.

Disney is becoming more reliant on Disney+ as movie theaters have been unable to recover after being shuttered in March due to the outbreak. Ticket sales have been particularly lackluster at domestic cinemas since the industry attempted a large-scale reopening in late August.

In recent months, the company pushed back a number of its theatrical releases including its Marvel blockbuster “Black Widow.” The much anticipated Pixar film “Soul” has also been postponed. It will now arrive on Disney+ in December.

Analysts are still awaiting word from Disney about how “Mulan” fared after Disney removed it from theatrical release and sold it through Disney+ for $30. It is expected the company will share more details about its performance during its next earnings report in November.

Daniel will be responsible, in part, for making big decisions about Disney’s theatrical and streaming release schedules going forward.

″[Consumers] are going to lead us,” Chapek said on “Closing Bell.” “Right now they are voting with their pocketbooks, and they are voting very heavily toward Disney+. We want to make sure that we are going the way the consumers want us to go.”

**Reorganizing Disney’s media business**

Alan Horn and Alan Bergman will remain in charge of the company’s studios, Peter Rice will continue to head the company’s general entertainment group, and James Pitaro will stay as head of the company’s sports content.

All will report directly to CEO Bob Chapek. The company’s parks, experiences and products segment will remain under the leadership of Josh D’Amaro, and Rebecca Campbell will remain on as the chairman of direct-to-consumer and international operations. Campbell will report directly to Chapek for all things related to international operations but will report to Daniel when it comes to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.

“Given the incredible success of Disney+ and our plans to accelerate our direct-to-consumer business, we are strategically positioning our Company to more effectively support our growth strategy and increase shareholder value,” Chapek said in a statement announcing the reorganization. “Managing content creation distinct from distribution will allow us to be more effective and nimble in making the content consumers want most, delivered in the way they prefer to consume it.”

Under Horn and Bergman, the studios segment will focus on creating content for theatrical release, Disney+ and Hulu. Walt Disney Studios, Marvel Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures all fall under their purview.

Rice’s general entertainment segment includes 20th Television, ABC Signature and Touchstone Television, ABC News, Disney Channels, Freeform, FX and National Geographic.

As for Pitaro’s sports segment, that will focus on live sports programming, sports news and original and nonscripted sports-related content across ESPN, ESPN+ and ABC.

Daniel’s media and entertainment distribution group will manage all distribution, operations, sales and advertising across the three content groups. Daniel has spent 14 years with the company in a variety of positions. He helped transform Disney’s Star Wars property into the two Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge lands in Disney World and Disneyland as well as aided in bringing Toy Story Land, Pixar Pier and Avengers Campus to the parks.

“Kareem is an exceptionally talented, innovative and forward-looking leader, with a strong track record for developing and implementing successful global content distribution and commercialization strategies,” said Chapek.

This new structure is effective immediately. The company currently expects to transition its financial reporting to reflect these changes beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.

Additionally, Disney announced that it will hold a virtual investor day on Dec. 10.

&lt;p&gt;XOM (-23.37%)

,investing,"I want to thank FelixYYZ for some of the links/information. One of the things I am always amazed with is how much those that really know are willing to share freely and how impeccable &amp; detailed the resources they share are.

On the Personal Finance (US) sub you get a lot of discussion around VTI or VOO/IVV and then VXUS.

VTI or VOO/IVV for low expense ratio, re-balancing and the conservative and proven wisdom of not being able to time or generally pick winners and losers long term and broad exposure to the US market or the large cap companies within the US market.

VXUS for again the exposure to the international scene incase of stalling or underperformance in the US market.

In the Investing/Stocks/Stock Market Sub you will see people talk about individual equities both international and domestic at good buy in rates and the need to understand reality valuations vs bull rallies. Most individuals still recommend Index Funds or at least practice purchasing the major holdings at what they consider good valuations.

WSB and Options is more geared to the risky bull/rally timings and daily/weekly option plays.

Personal Finance Canada seems to really favor a spread out approach with globally diversified assets allocation etf’s. The canadian mentality of common sense wisdom and not putting your eggs all in one basket. They say the VXUS doesn't go far enough in diversification.

We all know the US market has been on fire for nearly the last decade but especially in the last 5 years. I like I am sure many have no idea if that will continue or not but I do have some questions that I think many would find valuable to know.

My first question is about ETF's based on the international/emerging market scene.

I really only know about VXUS. I know that iShares has a really popular list of ""international and emerging market"" etfs:

EEM iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF IEMG iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF IEFA iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF EWG iShares MSCI Germany ETF EWJ iShares MSCI Japan ETF EWH iShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF EWT iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF EZU iShares MSCI EMU ETF EWY iShares MSCI South Korea ETF INDA iShares MSCI India ETF MCHI iShares MSCI China ETF EWU iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF RSX VanEck Vectors Russia ETF SCHF Schwab International Equity ETF

Most of the above are listed on the NYSEARCA or the BATS.

As a Canadian using BMO Investorline do we have access to buy off these? I know we have access to TSX, Nasdaq, DOW, S&amp;P 500 companies but I don't know if a regular account for Canadian Bank Brokerages have access to these?

My second question would be how do you practice international/emerging market diversification? Do you purchase those etfs above or do you have different ones? How do you put this in practice and is there a ""standard"" that is well known like the S&amp;P 500 index funds and total market funds like VTI that are well known, well respected, and well documented/used and what is your mentality and approach when using them.

Lastly is there a way to purchase index funds for the international markets? For example when I look at the DOW/S&amp;P 500/Nasdaq I see they are about equal or in the case of the last two greater than before the heights of COVID. I look at Canada TSX, German DAX, India Sensex and I see they are just slightly below the all time highs 2-8%. I look at the UK and FTSE 100 Index and I see it is around 20% down still. If I wanted to buy an index fund of FTSE 100 Index can I do that like I would purchase a VOO?

What would be the most respected index fund etfs like VOO/IVV for the various global indexes?

In general how do you guys all approach this, I think the question of international doesn't get a lot of detailed discussion like the US based index funds we have a ton of info on and the most respected and utilized ones. We also get a ton of talk on individual equities and the ways to practice technical analysis but not so much when it comes to global and emerging markets. I know it's more foreign and maybe because of that we don't have the same level of discussion because people aren't as exposed but I think maybe this is the time to hear from those that truly know and what they can all share :)

The 2010 revenue stands at 2010. $95,778B USD but in 2019  $256,776B USD.

CVS has a one year target of 79.44 which is about 15 dollars off its current price of 59.72. They also pay a solid dividend of 2.00  with a yield of (3.37%). When a company pays a dividend you know that some extra cash and is more secure then some growth companies. It dates back to 2001 with a yield of 0.52%. 

I believe a possible growth Catalyst for CVS could be a minute Clinic which acts an ER but for not so serious problems. The tele medicine market is growing and many will partner with CVS as it acts with base as a pharmacy and Minute Clinic which will continue to grow deliveries of Drugs with also grow and more and more live from home. The Baby Boomers are growing older and as more people grow old tight need more drugs which CVS can supply as they are the number one pharmacy in the USA by revenue.

I think that CVS was in a downtrend for the last 5 years but it can rise to around 80 dollars a share and it can also be a good dividend play combined with some growth with this he stock which is very good as it a win win situation.

&lt;p&gt;I believe a possible growth Catalyst for CVS could be a minute Clinic which acts an ER but for not so serious problems. The tele medicine market is growing and many will partner with CVS as it acts with base as a pharmacy and Minute Clinic which will continue to grow deliveries of Drugs with also grow and more and more live from home. The Baby Boomers are growing older and as more people grow old tight need more drugs which CVS can supply as they are the number one pharmacy in the USA by revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that CVS was in a downtrend for the last 5 years but it can rise to around 80 dollars a share and it can also be a good dividend play combined with some growth with this he stock which is very good as it a win win situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Guru Focus they have a Intrinsic value of 111.77 and that shows a lot of upside based on a FCF based model. &lt;a href=""https://www.gurufocus.com/term/iv_dcf_share/NYSE:CVS/Price-to-Projected-FCF/CVS-Health""&gt;https://www.gurufocus.com/term/iv_dcf_share/NYSE:CVS/Price-to-Projected-FCF/CVS-Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe CVS is a safe stock and has some upside so I think it could be good value play in your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

3. The third notion that Wall Street has now priced in a Biden victory and sees the large stimulus that is expected with a blue wave as overriding the negativity associated with tax hikes and more regulation is also ridiculous. At best, they cancel each other out.

Obviously there are long term plays out there; clean energy as a Biden victory becomes more likely, marijuana stocks as there is obviously a huge market for it as it continues to become legalized across the board, certain consumer cyclical companies, travel and leisure and certain REITS that have been absolutely beaten down.

,investing,"A number of posts have popped up in recent days about investing in ETFs with recent outsized gains (and high fees) like the ARK family of ETFs.  No doubt, most people are interested in ARK because of their recent returns, e.g. ARKW has returned 63% in 1 yr.

In response, a number of people have cited research showing that most active fund managers underperform the market even before fees, and almost all underperform net of fees.  

*While true, I believe there are some important nuances missing from this discussion.*

1)  The key point to understand is that, on average, active managers do not add alpha based on pure stock picking skills (net of fees and an on a risk adjusted basis).  So if you're looking at investing into a general discretionary ETF/MF where the manager is picking stocks from all-caps and any geography he desires, it is very difficult to know ex ante if that manager will outperform sufficiently to justify the high fees these types of funds typically charge (0.9%+).  An example of a successful general discretionary fund is Lynch's Magellan fund.  Another one that is currently active is the Fidelity Contrafund run by Will Danoff.  Danoff has consistently beaten the S&amp;P500 for 20+ years and is the sole manager of the fund, a rarity in the Mutual Fund world.  

2)  HOWEVER, managers can outperform the market through exposure to documented and validated risk factors and behavioral factors.  This is where the 'smart beta' term comes in and exposure to factors such as value, momentum, quality, low volatility, etc.  Historically, many fund managers who claimed to generate alpha were really just buying stocks that were cheap, profitable, and low vol.  Buffett's alpha for example, is almost entirely explained by those 3 factors.  This takes nothing away from Buffett's skill, as he was investing this way far before most other investors and the academic world caught on.  Nowadays, however, once you account for those factors, most managers' alpha disappears.  

3)  It is nearly impossible to judge an ETF/MF on the basis of a few years of returns.  This is because financials markets go through regimes/cycles that can last 10-20 years and an ETF that performs well in one part of the cycle may perform disastrously in another.  Bill Miller's fund is a good example of this.  Even stocks on the whole can underperform bonds for long stretches as they did back in the 70s.

Putting everything together:

If you are considering investing in a non-index ETF/MF there are several points to consider:

* Process:  Does the fund use a clear, transparent, and rigorous process to select stocks?  Or do they just use a bunch of jargon and terms like 'capital appreciation' and 'growth' to justify charging 1%+ fees?  

* Closet indexers:  Many active funds are really closet indexers.  Look at their current holdings, and weight of the top 10 holdings in the overall portfolio.  Are they basically replicating an index but charging 10x the fees?  Or are they making high conviction picks for a portfolio with no more than 25-50 holdings?

* Time frame:  How long has the fund been active?  How many managers has the fund had?  What is the lifetime return net of fees?  Frankly, less than 15 years of returns is a short time period.  Be very careful extrapolating past returns if the fund hasn't gone through at least one full market cycle.  Chasing recent returns with no consideration paid to process and transparency is a great recipe for underperforming in the future.

* Fees:  While I have no argument with John Bogle who showed quite convincingly that a low cost index fund is the best choice for most investors, if you have the motivation, discipline, and curiosity to be more active then you always need to ask yourself the question:  what am I getting for the fees I'm paying?  For a S&amp;P500 index fund, you're paying 3-4 basis points for the convenience of not having to periodically buy and rebalance 500 stocks - the value is pretty clear, and you're not paying for any selection capabilities.  But what about an ARK Fund, or a Target Date fund?  What about a 'smart beta' fund like the Avantis small-cap value fund $AVUV?  Do you really understand what the managers are doing behind the scenes?  If you're going to pay more than 30bps you owe it to yourself to understand this in detail.  

An example to tie these concepts together:

Since ARK funds are so popular let's consider these concepts in the context of ARKW.  

&gt;""Companies within the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) are focused on and expected to benefit from shifting the bases of technology infrastructure to the cloud, enabling mobile, new and local services, such as companies that rely on or benefit from the increased use of shared technology, infrastructure and services, internet-based products and services, new payment methods, big data, the internet of things, and social distribution and media.""

* Process implications:  This is not a general discretionary fund, it specifically provides exposure to cloud-focused and cloud-adjacent companies.  If you read the prospectus, you'll see that they use both top-down and bottom-up methodologies to identify companies to invest in.  Also they say they invest across all-caps, and foreign stocks, and also evaluate ESG characteristics.  This process is certainly more transparent than a typical discretionary fund, but less than an index or a smart beta structured fund.  IMO, the value of this process is that stock selection is done across industries and tends to load more heavily on high R&amp;D/intangibles and capital-light companies.

* Closet indexing?  The fund holds only 35-50 stocks, so not a closet indexer.

* Time frame?  Only been in existence since 2014 so it hasn't gone through a full market cycle yet.  From 2014 to 2018 the fund performance was nothing special.  And from 2018 to the end of 2019 the fund was almost flat.  The VAST majority of lifetime performance has come from its performance since Mar 2020.  

* Fees?  Approx. 0.75% - make no mistake, this is a high fee fund.  But at least you're not paying 75bps for a closet indexer.  What are you getting for this fee?  In theory, you're getting 1) targeted exposure to cloud stocks, and 2) the research and investing skill of Cathy Wood and her team.  But you could have exposure to cloud stocks through WCLD (0.45%), CLOU (0.68%), or SKYY (0.60%).  So are you comfortable paying an additional 15-30bps for their stock picking skills?    

Again, I'm not trying to provide investment advice, but rather highlight some key considerations in evaluating ETFs/MFs that I rarely see discussed.  I believe there can be place for non-index ETFs in one's portfolio, but it needs to be limited and it's critical that each investors understands what he/she is getting for the expense ratio.  I didn't discuss factor funds in much detail but they value they provide is again quite different from the value an ARK fund or index fund provides.

EDIT:  /u/MasterCookSwag has a great point in the comments about the importance of a fund's benchmark.  Not all funds are appropriately compared to the S&amp;P500, even though your personal investment decision may be between a S&amp;P500 index find vs. an active fund.  A fund that is large cap tech equity-focused would more appropriately be compared to QQQ, while a small cap value fund would be compared to the Russell 2k value index.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Process:  Does the fund use a clear, transparent, and rigorous process to select stocks?  Or do they just use a bunch of jargon and terms like &amp;#39;capital appreciation&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;growth&amp;#39; to justify charging 1%+ fees?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closet indexers:  Many active funds are really closet indexers.  Look at their current holdings, and weight of the top 10 holdings in the overall portfolio.  Are they basically replicating an index but charging 10x the fees?  Or are they making high conviction picks for a portfolio with no more than 25-50 holdings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time frame:  How long has the fund been active?  How many managers has the fund had?  What is the lifetime return net of fees?  Frankly, less than 15 years of returns is a short time period.  Be very careful extrapolating past returns if the fund hasn&amp;#39;t gone through at least one full market cycle.  Chasing recent returns with no consideration paid to process and transparency is a great recipe for underperforming in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fees:  While I have no argument with John Bogle who showed quite convincingly that a low cost index fund is the best choice for most investors, if you have the motivation, discipline, and curiosity to be more active then you always need to ask yourself the question:  what am I getting for the fees I&amp;#39;m paying?  For a S&amp;amp;P500 index fund, you&amp;#39;re paying 3-4 basis points for the convenience of not having to periodically buy and rebalance 500 stocks - the value is pretty clear, and you&amp;#39;re not paying for any selection capabilities.  But what about an ARK Fund, or a Target Date fund?  What about a &amp;#39;smart beta&amp;#39; fund like the Avantis small-cap value fund $AVUV?  Do you really understand what the managers are doing behind the scenes?  If you&amp;#39;re going to pay more than 30bps you owe it to yourself to understand this in detail.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example to tie these concepts together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since ARK funds are so popular let&amp;#39;s consider these concepts in the context of ARKW.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Companies within the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) are focused on and expected to benefit from shifting the bases of technology infrastructure to the cloud, enabling mobile, new and local services, such as companies that rely on or benefit from the increased use of shared technology, infrastructure and services, internet-based products and services, new payment methods, big data, the internet of things, and social distribution and media.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Process implications:  This is not a general discretionary fund, it specifically provides exposure to cloud-focused and cloud-adjacent companies.  If you read the prospectus, you&amp;#39;ll see that they use both top-down and bottom-up methodologies to identify companies to invest in.  Also they say they invest across all-caps, and foreign stocks, and also evaluate ESG characteristics.  This process is certainly more transparent than a typical discretionary fund, but less than an index or a smart beta structured fund.  IMO, the value of this process is that stock selection is done across industries and tends to load more heavily on high R&amp;amp;D/intangibles and capital-light companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closet indexing?  The fund holds only 35-50 stocks, so not a closet indexer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time frame?  Only been in existence since 2014 so it hasn&amp;#39;t gone through a full market cycle yet.  From 2014 to 2018 the fund performance was nothing special.  And from 2018 to the end of 2019 the fund was almost flat.  The VAST majority of lifetime performance has come from its performance since Mar 2020.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fees?  Approx. 0.75% - make no mistake, this is a high fee fund.  But at least you&amp;#39;re not paying 75bps for a closet indexer.  What are you getting for this fee?  In theory, you&amp;#39;re getting 1) targeted exposure to cloud stocks, and 2) the research and investing skill of Cathy Wood and her team.  But you could have exposure to cloud stocks through WCLD (0.45%), CLOU (0.68%), or SKYY (0.60%).  So are you comfortable paying an additional 15-30bps for their stock picking skills?    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I&amp;#39;m not trying to provide investment advice, but rather highlight some key considerations in evaluating ETFs/MFs that I rarely see discussed.  I believe there can be place for non-index ETFs in one&amp;#39;s portfolio, but it needs to be limited and it&amp;#39;s critical that each investors understands what he/she is getting for the expense ratio.  I didn&amp;#39;t discuss factor funds in much detail but they value they provide is again quite different from the value an ARK fund or index fund provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:  &lt;a href=""/u/MasterCookSwag""&gt;/u/MasterCookSwag&lt;/a&gt; has a great point in the comments about the importance of a fund&amp;#39;s benchmark.  Not all funds are appropriately compared to the S&amp;amp;P500, even though your personal investment decision may be between a S&amp;amp;P500 index find vs. an active fund.  A fund that is large cap tech equity-focused would more appropriately be compared to QQQ, while a small cap value fund would be compared to the Russell 2k value index.  The risk characteristics and selection universes are different.&lt;/p&gt;

I recently listened to Jesse Felder's podcast interview with Leigh Goehring: [https://thefelderreport.com/2020/10/07/leigh-goehring-on-the-generational-opportunity-in-energy-stocks-today/](https://thefelderreport.com/2020/10/07/leigh-goehring-on-the-generational-opportunity-in-energy-stocks-today/)

Energy is really hated right now for many reasons, including:  
\- High supply  
\- Low demand due to decreased air travel  
\- EVs are on the rise  
\- Writeoffs of non-profitable plants

There are a lot of companies to look at, but when there are large sellofs, I prefer to look for opportunity in the dominant players that are less likely to default. Specifically, I'm looking at CVX and XOM:

\- Screenshot: [https://imgur.com/a/z0PCrDW](https://imgur.com/a/z0PCrDW)

My reasons for buying:  
\- High shareholder equity per share relative to stock price.  
\- Historically low EV/Operation\_CF ratio.  
\- Historically low P/B. This could eventually change depending on the writeoffs though...  
\- Higher than normal but reasonable debt/equity ratios.  
\- Dividends are unlikely to be cut, and relatively high dividend yields can be locked in at current prices.

I know the long-term (&gt; 50 years) prospects of the energy sector aren't positive, but I don't see it going anywhere in the next 20 years or so. This is especially true after post-COVID issues settle. 

One signal I'm looking for that I'm not seeing is insider activity. I'd be a lot more confident in this buying decision if I saw more insider buys.

These companies can obviously go bankrupt, and the prospects look very grim until COVID is 100% resolved and everyone is comfortable herding around. However, the best time to invest is when there's blood on the streets?

My reasons for buying:  
\- There will be a long lineup of movies to be released by various studios all at once.  
\- AMC has more cash per share than the current's stock price  
\- CNK has a high equity per share value than the current stock price  
\- You can lock in a high dividend yield at current prices. I wouldn't be surprised if this gets cut though.

And:

&gt; In a video statement released by the company in August, Lordstown Motors CEO Steve Burns said [the reverse merger] financing was “the last piece we needed” to reach the company's goal of putting its first vehicle, the all-electric Endurance pickup truck, into production in 2021.

Unlike what happened with other reverse merger companies recently, the stock price is still in the low 20s.

The truck is officially called the ‘Class 8 fuel-cell electric truck’, and will be based on the existing Hino XL series and powered by Toyota’s own fuel-cell technology. The project is still in the design phase, but the company hopes to have a demonstration version of the vehicle ready to unveil to audiences early next year.

Meanwhile GM went with NKLA and now looks like a fool.

And I am here to add another.


**THE THEORY**


Dollar-Cost Averaging is supposed to take advantages of the ups and downs of the market, ensuring that you hit every lull in the market as well as buy when the market is overvalued.

*The Methods and Theory described below are purely for the S&amp;P 500 and not for any other index or fund.*

We all know plainly, that if we were to invest all of our money that we will invest in our lives all at once, at the beginning of our careers we would. This would allow us to have a single great return equivalent to the % increase in market value at the beginning of our career to the end.

We all know this is not possible, we cannot live in destitution for the first part of our careers in-order to accomplish this goal.

So the theory is this, dollar-cost averaging could be better applied in single, annual deposits as opposed to on a more frequent basis. 

The theory seems obvious in thought when considering the above paragraphs, but people are often afraid and/or unable to make single annual deposits into their 401k as opposed to dragging it out over the course of a year, citing the fact that the market could crash and that dragging it out will take advantage of it. To the previous statement I am calling BC.


**THE MODEL**


Like in my last post, I have stock market data and average dividends since the 1920s. *Below will summarize the findings from the previous post.* The person being modeled is one who will earn the equivalent of $80k a year (2020) and is adjusted up/down for inflation no matter the year. The person is targeting 15% contribution to his 401k ($12k) annually, and again this is adjusted year by year for inflation. The start year is adjustable, but always ends EOY 2019.

This is where the model splits. In one series of models, the person will put 15% of his paycheck into the stockmarket on a **monthly basis.** In the other series of models, the person puts 15% of his paycheck into the stockmarket all at once, **one time a year.**

I decided to only look at the years from 1980 to present. I did not look beyond that time period. My standard of performance comparison was total return by EOY 2019 and a 10 year return from the starting year (e.g. 1/1/1980 to 1/1/1990).

(Keep in mind, I understand that this is not possible. It may take some number of months to get to your target contribution amount, but the principle remains the same).

**THE RESULTS**

[Graphical Results](https://imgur.com/gallery/Rqv4F0d) are pretty simple to interpret, but I will say what it shows plainly.

*It is better to put all your annual contribution in at one point (or as fast as you can) as opposed to doing it on a more frequent basis.

*There was never a 10 year period in the last 30 years that I could find where there was a net negative return.

*The average 10 year return across all 30 years was 5.75%.


The implications of this are fairly simple. Its not advantageous to worry about the market crashing with respect to Dollar Cost Averaging. Regardless of your thoughts and feelings on the market, you should put as much money in as quickly as possible until you hit your target.

**SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS FINDINGS**

*There is no reactionary strategy that can allow you to flip from fixed income to stocks in a sell-all style in order to take advantage of crashes.

*High-Pass Filter analysis doesnt work.

*Annual rebalances do not work.

*3 month average comparisons do not work.

*Its simply better to go 100% into the S&amp;P 500.

*For bonds to be advantageous given the sell-all style, they would have extraordinarily high returns in excess of 7%, due simply to the fact that dividends do exist and raise earnings on the S&amp;P 500 over that of a simple point comparison.",t2_38ltuma2,False,,0,False,MODELING - Dollar-Cost Averaging: Annual vs Monthly Buy-Ins,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_j9c68j,False,dark,0.81,,public,27,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,27,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1602474746.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I have been modelling different Dollar-Cost Averaging Methods for sometime &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f10d5p/modeled_65_years_of_sp_500_w_dividends_coupled/""&gt;Link to Old Post&lt;/a&gt; and I have gathered a few nuggets of seemingly obvious information.

&amp;#x200B;

Although the market sentiment has been driven up by optimism about corporate earnings, the market has also remained volatile in light of Trump's remarks on the stimulus package. This is reflected in the swing from ""No more negotiations until after the election"" to ""We will consider X, Y, Z"". Recent upticks have been built on the anticipation of a stimulus package. As we get closer to the election, and many Senate Republicans still opposed to a large spending bill, I wonder how much of ""unicorn"" stimulus package being leveraged here is to prop up the market to signal ""growth in the economy""? By dangling the stimulus package as a way to keep market sentiment up, the administration can point to up-beat outlook in markets. But how long will markets hold-out for this bill until it becomes too late? I suppose my question is, is there a ""damage has already been done"" threshold?

After the deal seemed dead on &lt;a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-congress/pelosi-says-trump-stimulus-proposal-is-one-step-forward-two-steps-back-idUSKBN26V0SR?utm_source=reddit.com""&gt;Saturday&lt;/a&gt; (again), Kudlow suggests that &lt;a href=""https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/11/kudlow-mnuchin-stimulus-trump-428671""&gt;Mnuchin may bring up the stimulus number&lt;/a&gt; to appease to Pelosi and the House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the market sentiment has been driven up by optimism about corporate earnings, the market has also remained volatile in light of Trump&amp;#39;s remarks on the stimulus package. This is reflected in the swing from &amp;quot;No more negotiations until after the election&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;We will consider X, Y, Z&amp;quot;. Recent upticks have been built on the anticipation of a stimulus package. As we get closer to the election, and many Senate Republicans still opposed to a large spending bill, I wonder how much of &amp;quot;unicorn&amp;quot; stimulus package being leveraged here is to prop up the market to signal &amp;quot;growth in the economy&amp;quot;? By dangling the stimulus package as a way to keep market sentiment up, the administration can point to up-beat outlook in markets. But how long will markets hold-out for this bill until it becomes too late? I suppose my question is, is there a &amp;quot;damage has already been done&amp;quot; threshold? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

Following a rigorous science-based review of the premarket tobacco product applications (PMTAs) submitted by the company, the agency determined that authorizing these reduced nicotine products for sale in the U.S. is appropriate for the protection of the public health because of, among several key considerations, the potential to reduce nicotine dependence in addicted adult smokers, who may also benefit from decreasing nicotine exposure and cigarette consumption. The agency determined that non-smokers, including youth, are also unlikely to start using the products, and those who experiment are less likely to become addicted than people who experiment with conventional cigarettes.

XXII is in the FINAL stages of their MRTP (Modified risk tobacco product) application and are expecting results any day now. This application allows them to market and label their products with claims to the effects of their cigarettes (95% less nicotine consumption, etc). They have announced that they have a plan to commercialize in the US within 90 days of receiving approval.

To this end, we have increased the Company’s proactive efforts with the FDA to authorize our MRTP application, as we believe that there is an urgent public health need for a reduced nicotine content combustible alternative like VLN®. We now believe it is not a matter of if but *when* our application will be granted, and we believe we are months, not years, away from securing our MRTP designation. I am also proud to report that **we** **have plans in place to commercialize VLN®** **in the U.S.** **90 days after** **we receive our** **MRTP authorization**. These plans include all aspects of supply, manufacturing, sales, and a marketing campaign that has been designed to introduce adult U.S. smokers to the world’s lowest nicotine content cigarette.

To give you an idea of the effect of tobacco currently, here are some facts from the CDC's site!

[https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data\_statistics/fact\_sheets/fast\_facts/index.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/index.htm)

* Worldwide, tobacco use causes more than 7 million deaths per year.2 If the pattern of smoking all over the globe doesn’t change, more than 8 million people a year will die from diseases related to tobacco use by 2030.3
* Cigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the United States, including more than 41,000 deaths resulting from secondhand smoke exposure. This is about one in five deaths annually, or 1,300 deaths every day.1

Total economic cost of smoking is more than $300 billion a year, including

* Nearly $170 billion in direct medical care for adults6
* More than $156 billion in lost productivity due to premature death and exposure to secondhand smoke1

**Many adult cigarette smokers want to quit smoking.**

* In 2015, nearly 7 in 10 (68.0%) adult cigarette smokers wanted to stop smoking.
* In 2018, more than half (55.1%) adult cigarette smokers had made a quit attempt in the past year.
* In 2018, more than 7 out of every 100 (7.5%) people who tried to quit succeeded.

68% of cigarette smokers want to quit. In 2015. The pandemic is surely increasing this number, highlighting how important lung/heart health is. 55% made a quit attempt and NOT EVEN 10% OF THEM WERE SUCCESSFUL. 1300 PEOPLE A DAY DIE FROM SMOKING IN THE US. 22,000 GLOBALLY.

What does this mean for XXII?

Our consumer market research indicates that **60%** **of smokers** **have an interest in using** **VLN®** **cigarettes**. There are 34 million smokers in the US and more than 1 billion worldwide. Indeed, having the only combustible cigarette with a modified exposure claim authorized by the FDA, the world’s preeminent life-sciences regulatory body, could serve as a catalyst for 22nd Century’s commercial sales as even achieving just one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) market share of the U.S. tobacco market could result in revenues that may over time, based on current market multiples, drive the Company’s market capitalization more than 5 to 10 times higher than it is today. In addition, FDA authorizing the marketing of 22nd Century’s modified risk tobacco products with modified exposure claims would open multiple licensing opportunities for 22nd Century’s proprietary reduced nicotine content *tobacco* *to accelerate the* *commercial* *and public health potential.* These opportunities could significantly drive increases to 22nd Century’s market value.

The information above is only covering their tobacco side. They are working to expand the cannabis side and work on plant engineering to produce high quality cannabis with high percentages of isolated or mixed cannabinoids, depending on what the use is for. We're talking super high THC% weed, CBD, and many of the other cannabinoids in cannabis that are barely talked about.

This stock took some heavy hits. A few years ago it was 4-6 times the price it is now. Why? There was a big plan to actually mandate nicotine levels in cigarettes in the US. Essentially, the FDA wanted to only permit cigarettes with non-addictive levels of nicotine in them. This news made xxii shoot up as they were the only ones with the technology and patents to get this done.

Gottlieb, the head of the FDA, was the man spearheading this mandate. But he announced he was stepping down in early 2019 and the stock took a hit as the FDA has pushed that agenda aside.

Since then the stock has dropped and dropped to ridiculous levels. Now seems like the perfect time to buy for a speculative play.

&lt;p&gt;Gottlieb, the head of the FDA, was the man spearheading this mandate. But he announced he was stepping down in early 2019 and the stock took a hit as the FDA has pushed that agenda aside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then the stock has dropped and dropped to ridiculous levels. Now seems like the perfect time to buy for a speculative play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do with this info what you will. Feel free to ask me a question or tell me I&amp;#39;m an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;

However,  I've always been interested into investing in dividends stocks to become financialy independent over time. So far my trades have been 50-50 in profits/loss so I wanna stop trying to time the market. It doesn't work. 

So, typically, how much money invested do you need to make a decent living off the dividends ? Like 60k/year or so. I know it's hard to narrow down exactly because dividends come and go, can be reduced, halted, etc.   


**A quick look at my financial profile**

* I'm 35 years old
* making roughly 5000$ US dollars after all deductions per month (annual salary increases by 2% every April)
* I don't have any payments to make (cell phone, housing, etc. - all paid). 
* In theory, I have 4000$ US dollars every month of disposable income.
* However, I only have a little more than 20k$ US worth of savings so far.

&lt;p&gt;This License only covers your individual, personal use of the Software.

,investing,"Hi all,

I am fairly new to investing, so forgive any silly questions, I am making a few assumptions based on what my understanding is as of writing this.

Currently I have a Roth IRA and a Brokerage account. Specifically for the Roth, I was looking for a solid company with stable growth/dividends. I have been reading up on the Brookfield line of stocks and am a bit confused on one thing, is it an MLP or is it not? Seems like its structured like one but they state in [terms of taxes they are not.](https://bep.brookfield.com/~/media/Files/B/Brookfield-BEP-IR-V2/tax-information/2019/bep-tax-2019-us-presentation-vf.pdf) (page 2)

As I understand, one should avoid MLP's within a tax exempt account because of the possible UBTI tax trigger that occurs if gains reach over $1000. However, from what I am reading, while BEP is considered an MLP(?) and you get a K1, they say they [do not generate UBTI](https://bep.brookfield.com/stock-and-distribution/tax-information).

To backup quickly, this concern stemmed from initially looking at ET (Energy Transfer LP). Long story short and I could very well be wrong, is that this is a bad choice to have in an IRA because of the UBTI issue and from what I have read, the distributions (dividends) count towards the yearly UBTI total.

TLDR: Would owning BEP, BIP or BAM or all three in an IRA account be good or bad practice? Again, this is going off my assumption that the distributions count towards the annual UBTI total (like with the ET example). So if you theoretically owned enough of any of those shares to be getting a yearly distribution of $1000 or more, is this is tax issue (triggering a UBTI tax event) within a Roth IRA? Would these be better placed in a taxable brokerage account?

I am trying to understand my risk report from interactive brokers where I have portfolio margin. I don't fully understand ""Value at Risk"" or ""Expected shortfall"".

I changed my horizon to '4'. Using a historical VAR Scenario it says I have 51k at risk and a 71k expected shortfall with 99.9% confidence. Does this mean my estimated worst case scenario is losing 71k over a 4 day period?

Then I changed the VAR Scenario to ""MonteCarlo"". Under MonteCarlo scenario, I have 19k at risk and a 22k expected shortfall with 99.9% confidence. Does this mean my estimated worst case scenario is losing 22k over a 4 day period? 

Why are these values so much lower under a MonteCarlo scenario?

,investing,"IIPR's stock price closed at $129.78 a share at market close on Thursday 8th October 2020. As a real state investment trust, Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. (IIPR) concentrates on acquiring, owning and managing specialized industrial properties for regulated state-licensed cannabis facilities. In recent years the increasing acceptance of cannabis for medical &amp; recreational uses has fueled demands for the product and in turn more and more cannabis facilities are popping up around the states. IIPR is well positioned to take advantage of this growing trend.

I present below the grounds on which I believe this stock is poised for exceptional growth.

Increasing earnings:

One of the most common elements in stocks that post large gains is the increasing earnings in recent quarters. IIPR earnings for the last four quarters are shown below:

Q2 2020 USD 0.73, compare to Q2 2019 USD 0.30 an increase of 143%

Q1 2020 USD 0.72, compare to Q1 2019 USD 0.33 an increase of 118%

Q4 2019 USD 0.78, compare to Q4 2018 USD 0.24 an increase of 225%

Q3 2019 USD 0.55, compare to Q3 2018 USD 0.21 an increase of 162%

As can be seen, for all the last 4 quarters IIPR has posted an earnings increase of more than a 100% compared to the same quarter in previous year. This exceptional earnings trend and its consistency for the past 4 quarters shows that IIPR has fuel to rocket upward in the near future.

Tight trading range and accumulation: [Daily chart](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-05pZodborak/X3_UHAajHmI/AAAAAAAAAAw/oAChKnEM83gJ79gdGo3zZS_LtIxVIYVbwCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)

The stock is also exhibiting signs of money inflow and accumulation. In the daily chart above it can be noticed that that shares have been trading steadily in a range between $115 and $130 since mid August on higher than usual volume. Also, the range of daily price move has been smaller compared to the trend seen before August. This pattern usually is observed before a major upward breakout.

Steady base and impending breakout: [Weekly chart](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iqDJSEKdBX4/X3_WTu9jXyI/AAAAAAAAAA8/VZgjk_Ov9dE4nvTENgWRgMwYOQHMtxnkQCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)

Its can be seen from the weekly chart above that after hitting a high of ~$132 in July 2019 the stock price has consistently traded below this value and formed a double bottom W pattern. A decisive breakout above $132 a share on high volume is all that is needed to thrust the stock in a rapid upward trend. Interestingly, just this week the stock price has started to really test the resistance at $132. It would be wise to keep an eye out on this stock on Monday and in the coming weeks for a breakout. This breakout should be the entry point to open any new position. Make sure the volume is high on the the day it breaks out or else it may just be a false signal.

To sum up, IIPR is presenting very strong bullish signals and might skyrocket after a high volume breakout above $132 a share.

&gt;Our customers spend about one hour a day in their car and one hour a day away from their phone. Any car maker who tries to create an ecosystem around the car deserves to lose the customer,” says Martin Kristensson, head of digital business at Volvo Cars.

&amp;#x200B;

From the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-german-car-industry-musters-for-a-new-tech-battle-11602245653?mod=hp_lista_pos3)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Is the heart of your car a screen?  
&gt;  
&gt;Having spent years—and tens of billions of dollars—preparing for a shift in production toward electric vehicles, German car makers are expressing a new angst: that digitally “connected cars” could prove even more disruptive to their traditional strengths. This second leg of their race against Tesla could become a fresh excuse to squander investors’ capital.  
&gt;  
&gt;Daimler set two priorities for technological leadership in a new strategy for its [Mercedes-Benz](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DMLRY) [DMLRY **-0.55%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DMLRY?mod=chiclets)brand this week: electric drive and car software. For the latter, the company is working on an entire operating system, MB.OS, that from 2024 will run not just Mercedes’s proprietary infotainment system and its mobile broadband connection but also crucial elements of the driving experience, including self-driving features and battery management.  
&gt;  
&gt;The company will partner with technology specialists for specific applications, notably [Nvidia](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NVDA) for automated driving. Yet the closer the software gets to the customer experience, the more Daimler wants to do in-house. The interface with the driver in particular “is not something that we would like to outsource to somebody else,” said Chief Executive Ola Källenius.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Volkswagen](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/VOW) [VOW **+0.00%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/VOW?mod=chiclets)is on a similar road. At last week’s annual general meeting, Chief Executive Herbert Diess said replacing engines with electric batteries and motors would be simple to manage compared with the transformation of the car into a “fully networked mobility device.” He is tackling the challenge by investing heavily in coding: VW wants to increase the proportion of software written in-house to at least 60%, from 10% currently, at a cost of €7 billion, equivalent to $8.23 billion, by 2025.  
&gt;  
&gt;The shadow haunting the German automotive industry is, of course, Tesla. Mr. Diess regularly spurs on his managers by invoking the U.S. company’s technological lead and astronomical market value. The starring role accorded to the infotainment screen in a Tesla seems to be a popular feature with the kind of tech-loving consumers who might otherwise buy an [Audi](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/NSU). Auto makers are also envious of Tesla’s capacity to keep consumers’ systems fresh via “over-the-air” updates.  
&gt;  
&gt;One reason Daimler cited for focusing on software was the scope for using this kind of live digital connection with its customers to sell them services well after they have bought their Mercedes-Benz. Many manufacturers have talked of this potential, but Daimler was bold enough to pin a number on it: It hopes to make €1 billion in operating profit from digital services by 2025.  
&gt;  
&gt;The software industry has been through a wrenching transition over the past decade from selling one-off packages to subscriptions for access to a constantly updated, cloud-hosted service. As more vehicles are connected to the internet, infotainment systems are likely next in line. One big unknown is what consumers will be prepared to pay for, and who will get it—vehicle manufacturers or software developers. Another is how deeply the infotainment system will end up being linked to driving controls.  
&gt;  
&gt;For now, though, most car makers are more relaxed than Daimler and VW about ceding control of at least infotainment to the tech industry. [General Motors](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GM), Volvo Cars, the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi [alliance](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-partner-with-biggest-car-alliance-1537243260) and [Peugeot](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PUGOY) (which [Fiat-Chrysler](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FCAU) will likely follow) [all are partnering to varying extents](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gmturns-togooglefor-in-car-apps-voice-commands-11567692000) with Alphabet’s Google, which has developed a vehicle version of its smartphone operating system called Android Automotive.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Our customers spend about one hour a day in their car and one hour a day away from their phone. Any car maker who tries to create an ecosystem around the car deserves to lose the customer,” says Martin Kristensson, head of digital business at Volvo Cars.  
&gt;  
&gt;Volvo and others say partnering with Google makes sense because consumers already use and like its products. The glitchy reputation of auto makers’ existing vehicle infotainment systems adds weight to this argument. But partnering also is probably the cheaper option.  
&gt;  
&gt;“There are a lot of economies of scale in software development. Auto makers who want to get more programmers and do the work themselves are generally underestimating the costs,” says Mark Wakefield, co-leader of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners.  
&gt;  
&gt;The insistence of Daimler and VW on building up software skills might therefore be another iteration of their historic bias toward over-investment. The vast expense of electric-vehicle development has forced both companies to get more serious about cutting fixed costs in recent years; Mercedes-Benz this week committed to a 20% reduction by 2025. Ominously, though, the company also is charging into yet another technological battleground.  
&gt;  
&gt;Drivers and investors alike may end up preferring auto makers to focus on what they are best at: assembling cars.

&amp;#x200B;

Google makes the operating system that is in the majority of the world's phones.  The idea that VW is going to be able to really compete with that just doesn't make sense. Especially when their history of tech is pretty much a failure.

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;Our customers spend about one hour a day in their car and one hour a day away from their phone. Any car maker who tries to create an ecosystem around the car deserves to lose the customer,” says Martin Kristensson, head of digital business at Volvo Cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-german-car-industry-musters-for-a-new-tech-battle-11602245653?mod=hp_lista_pos3""&gt;WSJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the heart of your car a screen?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having spent years—and tens of billions of dollars—preparing for a shift in production toward electric vehicles, German car makers are expressing a new angst: that digitally “connected cars” could prove even more disruptive to their traditional strengths. This second leg of their race against Tesla could become a fresh excuse to squander investors’ capital.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daimler set two priorities for technological leadership in a new strategy for its &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DMLRY""&gt;Mercedes-Benz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DMLRY?mod=chiclets""&gt;DMLRY &lt;strong&gt;-0.55%&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;brand this week: electric drive and car software. For the latter, the company is working on an entire operating system, MB.OS, that from 2024 will run not just Mercedes’s proprietary infotainment system and its mobile broadband connection but also crucial elements of the driving experience, including self-driving features and battery management.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company will partner with technology specialists for specific applications, notably &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NVDA""&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; for automated driving. Yet the closer the software gets to the customer experience, the more Daimler wants to do in-house. The interface with the driver in particular “is not something that we would like to outsource to somebody else,” said Chief Executive Ola Källenius.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/VOW""&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/VOW?mod=chiclets""&gt;VOW &lt;strong&gt;+0.00%&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;is on a similar road. At last week’s annual general meeting, Chief Executive Herbert Diess said replacing engines with electric batteries and motors would be simple to manage compared with the transformation of the car into a “fully networked mobility device.” He is tackling the challenge by investing heavily in coding: VW wants to increase the proportion of software written in-house to at least 60%, from 10% currently, at a cost of €7 billion, equivalent to $8.23 billion, by 2025.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shadow haunting the German automotive industry is, of course, Tesla. Mr. Diess regularly spurs on his managers by invoking the U.S. company’s technological lead and astronomical market value. The starring role accorded to the infotainment screen in a Tesla seems to be a popular feature with the kind of tech-loving consumers who might otherwise buy an &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/NSU""&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt;. Auto makers are also envious of Tesla’s capacity to keep consumers’ systems fresh via “over-the-air” updates.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason Daimler cited for focusing on software was the scope for using this kind of live digital connection with its customers to sell them services well after they have bought their Mercedes-Benz. Many manufacturers have talked of this potential, but Daimler was bold enough to pin a number on it: It hopes to make €1 billion in operating profit from digital services by 2025.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software industry has been through a wrenching transition over the past decade from selling one-off packages to subscriptions for access to a constantly updated, cloud-hosted service. As more vehicles are connected to the internet, infotainment systems are likely next in line. One big unknown is what consumers will be prepared to pay for, and who will get it—vehicle manufacturers or software developers. Another is how deeply the infotainment system will end up being linked to driving controls.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, though, most car makers are more relaxed than Daimler and VW about ceding control of at least infotainment to the tech industry. &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GM""&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt;, Volvo Cars, the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-partner-with-biggest-car-alliance-1537243260""&gt;alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PUGOY""&gt;Peugeot&lt;/a&gt; (which &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FCAU""&gt;Fiat-Chrysler&lt;/a&gt; will likely follow) &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/gmturns-togooglefor-in-car-apps-voice-commands-11567692000""&gt;all are partnering to varying extents&lt;/a&gt; with Alphabet’s Google, which has developed a vehicle version of its smartphone operating system called Android Automotive.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our customers spend about one hour a day in their car and one hour a day away from their phone. Any car maker who tries to create an ecosystem around the car deserves to lose the customer,” says Martin Kristensson, head of digital business at Volvo Cars.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volvo and others say partnering with Google makes sense because consumers already use and like its products. The glitchy reputation of auto makers’ existing vehicle infotainment systems adds weight to this argument. But partnering also is probably the cheaper option.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of economies of scale in software development. Auto makers who want to get more programmers and do the work themselves are generally underestimating the costs,” says Mark Wakefield, co-leader of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insistence of Daimler and VW on building up software skills might therefore be another iteration of their historic bias toward over-investment. The vast expense of electric-vehicle development has forced both companies to get more serious about cutting fixed costs in recent years; Mercedes-Benz this week committed to a 20% reduction by 2025. Ominously, though, the company also is charging into yet another technological battleground.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drivers and investors alike may end up preferring auto makers to focus on what they are best at: assembling cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google makes the operating system that is in the majority of the world&amp;#39;s phones.  The idea that VW is going to be able to really compete with that just doesn&amp;#39;t make sense. Especially when their history of tech is pretty much a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think that the German automotive industry is going to be near the same in 10 years.  I wonder how that is going to impact Germany and Europe&amp;#39;s overall economy.&lt;/p&gt;

IBM is spinning off its legacy business of IT Management in order to attempt to return $IBM to its blue-chip glory. IBM will now look to take advantage of the[ $1T hybrid-cloud market](https://taylorhoffman.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=abfd6114e6972955bfd6f87f4&amp;id=26c150e11d&amp;e=0a139504b4) and its $34B acquisition of Red Hat in 2018. 

**Why does this Matter?**

This is a major shift for a company that has long been considered an American household name. The spinoff is expected to contain more than 50% of the current business, however, IBM is now positioned to be considered more of a software company than a services vendor moving forward. The operational costs of the spinoff are estimated to be in the $5B range.

The two separate firms will be paying a joint dividend in line with the expected dividend for the fourth quarter. From there, it is expected that IBM continues to look for future acquisition opportunities as they make an aggressive push for revenue growth.

&gt;Right now, the shares of the four named airlines are trading between 50 and 80% below their highs. Perhaps part of the gap will close as soon as investors realize that the risk of bankruptcy is fairly low thanks to generous government aid.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Southwest is likely to be the outperformer in the future. So if you want to bet on a rebound in the sector, then you’ve come to the right place.  
As long as the stock is trading above $ 38, a possible rise again to $ 40 and 42 could happen at any time. Above that, the way would be clear towards $44 and $46.  
For countercyclical investors, things get interesting near $36. This is where the long-term support zone begins, which extends to $30.

Among the stocks discussed, Southwest is particularly interesting for long-term investors. From my point of view, this is clearly the strongest US airline for various reasons.

,investing,"I'm writing this post because I saw discussions in some threads like the SQ/bitcoin thread about if there's any real difference between ""investing"" and ""speculation"".

I have a definition which I think is *useful*. It's not right or wrong, because I'm not the authority on language (nor is anyone) - but if you choose to adopt this definition for yourself, it can help you make financial decisions.

I'm also not passing judgement on speculation - you do what you want with your money. My own portfolio has a mixture of investment and speculation. This framework helps me understand what I'm getting into so I don't lay awake at night with cold sweats worried about my money.

To me, the definition of *investing* is that there has to be a hypothesis about how your money actually betters the thing being invested in, thus helping to generate the return. When there is no reason your money actually helps the underlying thing, it is *speculation*.

Here's an easy example, followed by applying this framework to common asset types:

* You put $10k into a restaurant so they can buy a new oven, thus opening up new menu possibilities and being able to serve more customers concurrently [this is investing] 
* You put $10k into AAPL stock - by contributing demand and liquidity, you increase the value of the stock. When AAPL uses that stock to compensate employees or to make acquisitions, they need less of it, thus allowing them to hire more employees or make more acquisitions which eventually improve the business [this is investing] (also obviously when they issue more stock and you buy it, you increase their cash reserves) 
* You put $10k into gold - you have not made gold any better. It's still the same thing it always was. [this is speculation]
* You put $10k into a gold mining company - they buy a new truck which helps them mine more efficiently. [this is investing]
* You put $10k into bitcoin - mining doesn't become more efficient. The coin doesn't 'do' anything to generate value for the world such as an oven would. [this is speculation]
* You buy $10k into Yen/Yuan/Euro/USD/etc - it's the same thing it always was. Having the currency doesn't improve the country somehow [this is speculation]
* You buy $10k of treasury bonds - the country uses it to build interstate roads, thus increasing commerce [this is investing]
* PUTS - a PUT in isolation is speculation, but used in concert with shares or other contracts could be considered part of an investment

This is useful in evaluating where you put your money and why. People get 'weak hands' when you *think* you *invested*, but you actually *speculated*. If you have a solid investment thesis with conviction, you won't be stricken with doubt when the price simply moves down (but you still have doubt if the company pivots)",t2_2f61h0jj,False,,0,False,"A useful distinction between ""Investing"" and ""Speculation""",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_j7veih,False,dark,0.09,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1602261687.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m writing this post because I saw discussions in some threads like the SQ/bitcoin thread about if there&amp;#39;s any real difference between &amp;quot;investing&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;speculation&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

As of the end of September, thematic ETFs made up 1.2% of the US ETF market, representing $59 billion in assets. Asset growth of 42% from the prior quarter easily exceeded the industry’s 7% growth. According to asset manager Global X, thematic investing refers to the process of identifying powerful, disruptive macro-level trends and the underlying investments that stand to benefit from the materialization of those trends. At the end of the third quarter, there were 135 such thematic ETFs, with six new funds including [**AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF (MSOS)**](http://etfdb.com/etf/MSOS/), [**Direxion Connected Consumer ETF (CCON)**](http://etfdb.com/etf/CCON/), [**Global X Telemedice &amp; Digital Health ETF (EDOC)**](http://etfdb.com/etf/EDOC/). No thematic ETFs closed during the third quarter.

Global X has grouped the 135 available thematic ETFs offered by a wide range of providers into three categories, ten mega-themes, and approximately three dozen themes. These mega-themes include big data, climate change, connectivity, health, and robotics. CFRA thinks thematic ETFs provide targeted exposure and the benefits of diversification as not all companies connected to powerful, disruptive macro-level trends will succeed as winning investments.

In the third quarter, big data ETFs such as [**First Trust NASDAQ CyberSecurity (CIBR)**](http://etfdb.com/etf/CIBR/) and [**Global X Cloud Computing (CLOU)**](http://etfdb.com/etf/CLOU/) helped power the mega-theme to $12 billion in assets, up from $10 billion a quarter earlier.  Meanwhile, assets of climate change mega-themed ETFs rose to $8.3 billion, from $5.1 billion aided by combined $3 billion of net inflows from [**Invesco Solar ETF (TAN)**](http://etfdb.com/etf/TAN/) and [**Invesco Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN)**](http://etfdb.com/etf/ICLN/). These ETFs provide access to U.S. and international stocks but offer unique exposure when CFRA looks at the [ETF holdings](https://firstbridgedata.com/).

Health was another popular mega-theme with actively managed [**ARK Genomics Revolution ETF (ARKG)**](http://etfdb.com/etf/ARKG/) nearly doubling in size to $2.3 billion with approximately $650 million of net inflows and the benefits of stock performance. Index-based [**Invesco Dynamic Biotechnology &amp; Genome ETF (PBE)**](http://etfdb.com/etf/PBE/) and [**iShares Genomics Immunology and Healthcare ETF (IDNA)**](http://etfdb.com/etf/IDNA/) are examples of other ETFs in the sub-category.

CFRA believes that we remain in the early stages of thematic ETF growth as investors find the benefits of long-term strategies without the single security risk of the past. These ETFs tend to charge a premium relative to the broader sector ETFs such as [**Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV)**](http://etfdb.com/etf/XLV/) and [**Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT)**](http://etfdb.com/etf/VGT/) but have more targeted exposure and greater chances to outperform or underperform the broader market.",t2_85vf7enj,False,,0,False,Thematic ETF Asset Growth Climbs Even Higher,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_j7uele,False,dark,0.7,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1602255947.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.etftrends.com/author/toddrosenbuth/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODD ROSENBLUTH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; OCTOBER 7, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is in advanced talks to buy rival chip maker Xilinx Inc., according to people familiar with the matter, in a deal that could be valued at more than $30 billion and mark the latest big tie-up in the rapidly consolidating semiconductor industry.

&gt;The companies are discussing a deal that could come together as soon as next week, the people said. There is no guarantee they will get there, especially given that the talks had stalled before recently restarting, according to some of the people.

&gt;AMD’s market value now tops $100 billion after its shares soared 89% this year as the coronavirus pandemic stokes demands for PCs, gaming consoles and other devices that use the company’s chips. Second-quarter revenue rose 26% to $1.93 billion, while net income jumped more than fourfold to $157 million on the back of record notebook and server-processor sales, AMD said.

&gt;The surge in AMD shares could embolden the company to make an acquisition using its stock as currency. Xilinx has a market value of about $26 billion, with its shares up about 9% so far this year, just ahead of the S&amp;P 500’s 7% rise.

&gt;With a typical takeover premium, a deal would value the company at more than $30 billion.

&gt;AMD, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is led by Chief Executive Lisa Su. In addition to desktop and notebook computers, it makes components used in gaming systems such as Xbox and PlayStation that have been in high demand as the pandemic forces people to stay at home. It also has a growing data-center-processor business that increasingly rivals that of Intel Corp., long the dominant player in that segment.

&gt;The addition of Xilinx, led by CEO Victor Peng, would put AMD on a more even competitive footing with Intel and give it a bigger position in fast-growing telecommunications and defense markets.

&gt;San Jose, Calif.-based Xilinx’s chips are used in wireless communications, data centers and industries such as automotive and aerospace. Its shares have been hurt by trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and namely the Trump administration’s limitations on shipments to China’s Huawei Technologies Co. because of security concerns. Analysts estimated Huawei accounted for roughly 6% to 8% of Xilinx’s revenue.

&gt;Xilinx makes microchips called field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs. Unlike standard chips, they can be reprogrammed after they are produced. That makes them valuable in rapid prototyping and in fast-emerging technologies where there isn’t enough time to go through a yearslong development process necessary for other chips.

&gt;FPGAs are commonly used in new superfast 5G telecommunications infrastructure, although they may be replaced later by standard chips once the technology is more mature. They are also often used in military communications and radar systems.

&gt;Intel is the other main player in the FPGA market, having built its business by acquiring Altera Corp. in 2015.

&gt;AMD, which specializes in central processing units that serve as computers’ digital brains, has been gaining share on Intel in recent years, releasing new generations of processors that match or beat its larger rival’s on many performance benchmarks. AMD had around a 20% share in personal computer CPUs as of the second quarter, according to Mercury Research, up from around 8% three years ago.

&gt;Consolidation has swept through the semiconductor industry as chip makers seek scale and expand their product portfolios to support the increasing number of everyday items that are connected to the internet. Xilinx, for one, has considered a number of potential tie-ups in recent years that didn’t come to fruition.

&gt;Should AMD and Xilinx reach an agreement, three of the year’s largest deals so far would be in the semiconductor industry, according to Dealogic data. Analog Devices Inc. in July agreed to pay more than $20 billion for Maxim Integrated Products Inc. and Nvidia Corp. in September agreed to pay $40 billion for Arm Holdings, the British chip designer backed by SoftBank Group Corp.

&gt;Mergers-and-acquisitions activity generally has been sluggish in 2020 as a result of the pandemic, with announced global and U.S. volume down 18% and 40%, respectively, according to Dealogic. Lately, however, it has shown signs of life as companies gain confidence to make big strategic moves. NextEra Energy Inc. recently approached Duke Energy Corp. with a takeover proposal that would likely value the North Carolina utility at well over $60 billion and count as the year’s largest deal.

&gt;That activity has confounded predictions that the looming election would cause deal makers to sit on their hands awaiting clarity on what kind of administration is likely to be calling the shots for the next four years.",t2_4g8exso,False,,0,False,"Advanced Micro Devices is in advanced talks to buy rival chip maker Xilinx, said people familiar with the matter, in a deal that could be valued at more than $30 billion",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_j7pz9a,False,dark,0.93,,public,119,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,119,,False,,1602207359.0,,[],{},,True,,1602235685.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;link to tweet from WSJ: &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/WSJ/status/1314374009002356738""&gt;https://twitter.com/WSJ/status/1314374009002356738&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As the United States continues its struggle with the pandemic-induced economic recession and a [sputtering recovery](https://www.cnn.com/business/economy), the country's burgeoning debt is not anyone's top concern these days.

&amp;#x200B;

Even deficit hawks are urging a dysfunctional Washington and a chaotic White House to approve another round of [badly needed stimulus](http://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/politics/stimulus-pelosi-trump-coronavirus/index.html) to the tune of trillions.

&amp;#x200B;

""The US federal budget is on an unsustainable path, has been for some time,"" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome [Powell said](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/economy/fed-powell-coronavirus-stimulus/index.html) this week. But, Powell added, ""This is not the time to give priority to those concerns.""

&amp;#x200B;

However, when the country eventually pulls out of its current health and economic crises, Americans will be left with a debt hangover.

&amp;#x200B;

On Thursday, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that for fiscal year 2020, which ended September 30, the US deficit hit $3.13 trillion -- or 15.2% of GDP -- thanks to the chasm between what the country spent ($6.55 trillion) and what it took in ($3.42 trillion) for the year.

&amp;#x200B;

As a share of the economy, the estimated 2020 deficit is more than triple what the annual deficit was in 2019. And it's the highest it has been since just after World War II.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason for the huge year-over-year jump is simple: Starting this spring, the federal government spent [more than $4 trillion](https://www.covidmoneytracker.org/) to help stem the economic pain to workers and businesses caused by sudden and widespread business shutdowns. And most people agree more money will need to be spent until the White House manages to get the Covid-19 crisis under control.

&amp;#x200B;

The Treasury Department won't put out final numbers for fiscal year 2020 until later this month. But if the CBO's estimates are on the mark, the country's total debt owed to investors -- which is essentially the sum of annual deficits that have accrued over the years -- will have outpaced the size of the economy, coming in at nearly 102% of GDP, according to calculations from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

&amp;#x200B;

The debt hasn't been that high since 1946, when the federal debt was 106.1% of GDP.""Debt is the size of the economy today, and soon it will be larger than any time in history,"" CRFB president Maya MacGuineas said.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with such high debt levels going forward is that they will increasingly constrain what the government can do to meet the country's needs.

&amp;#x200B;

Spending is projected to continue rising and is far outpacing revenue. And interest payments alone on the debt -- even if rates remain low -- will consume an ever-growing share of tax dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

Given the risks of future disruptions, like a pandemic, a debt load that already is outpacing economic growth puts the country at greater risk of a fiscal crisis, which in turn would require sharp cuts to the services and benefits on which Americans rely.

&amp;#x200B;

""There is no set tipping point at which a fiscal crisis becomes likely or imminent, nor is there an identifiable point at which interest costs as a percentage of GDP become unsustainable,"" CBO director Phillip Swagel said last month. ""But as the debt grows, the risks become greater.""

,investing,"(posting here because wsb as been a shitshow for years now. Position: 25k shares in $QST on the TSX)

Everyone is talking about green tech these days. Sure, democrat sweep in November and whatnot sets the stage for growth in clean energy.

But what is clean energy? Most people think CO2 is reduced through expanding in wind and solar. After all, the top 10 holdings of ICLN are wind and solar companies. Others will talk about overpriced electric car companies. Blah. 

But really, clean tech is going to come from improving the fossil fuel industry. 80% of power production and more than 90% of CO2e still come from fossil fuel sources in the US. The most potent GHG is methane, 25x more greenhouse potential than the same amount of carbon dioxide.

Its puzzling that: 

* Wind and solar and other renewables (mostly hydro, in the US) make up about 10% of energy production. We've seen nothing but hype hype hype coming out of the sector

* Methane emissions make up about 10% of the total CO2e emissions from any source. We've seen not a single peep out of the sector

Why is it that nobody is talking about the companies that do methane emissions reduction? For one, the companies are small and obscure, and most of them privately held. Two, their business is tied to the oil and gas sector, which has bad press among investors.

However, investors be damned, governments are paying attention:

1. Government of Canada has a [$750 million](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/science-data/funding-partnerships/funding-opportunities/current-funding-opportunities/emissions-reduction-fund/22781) methane emissions reduction grant, to fund capital investments in methane reduction for oil and gas companies (probably starting sometime next year)

2. State level, Colorado has been making big strides in methane regulation through the state’s Air Quality Control Commission and, to a lesser extent, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. California's Landfill Methane Regulation (LMR) requires municipal solid waste landfills to reduce methane and other air pollutant emissions through emissions monitoring and through capturing fugitive methane. North Dakota, etc

3. Federally, the Obama admin has made a number of regulatory moves through the EPA re: methane emissions from landfills and from oil and gas sources. Trump has rolled it back. These two articles may be of interest: [1](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/it-cannot-survive-why-trump-s-rollback-methane-rule-might-lose-court#:~:text=Under%20its%20rule%2C%20the%20Trump,processing%20segments%20of%20the%20industry.), [2](http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2020/01/31/the-status-of-methane-regulation-in-the-u-s/) 

**What are we looking at, in the future?**

The Biden campaign has already said that “[o]n day one, Biden will use the full authority of the executive branch to make progress and significantly reduce emissions” including by “[r]equiring aggressive methane pollution limits for new and existing oil and gas operations.” 

This, coupled with the trend of increased methane regulation across the world, creates an opportunity for companies that provide technology to capture or flare methane. Canada's grant alone is several times larger than the entire methane reduction industry.

In order to meet GHG targets, countries will have to aggressively target methane as it is a much more potent source of CO2e, and since it is concentrated mostly at point sources, it is much easier to control.

All it takes is a few regulatory steps in the right direction to to make the industry a big one

**Questor?**

* Their business is renting or selling enclosed incinerators that turn methane into CO2

* They're the only ISO ETV certified clean combustion company

* their business is currently mostly Colorado, ND, a bit in canada and a bit elsewhere

* no debt (except lease oblig and tax liabilities)

* 17MM in property and equipment (for rental)

* 15MM in cash

* like everyone else tethered to O&amp;G, they suffered quite a bit in the COVID downturn. But they're making it their priority to capture market share and enter new markets, while preserving the clean balance sheet. 

* they're also expanding their services to include methane emissions monitoring

**anyways, I think its an excellent industry with a lot of asymmetry in payoff (big money from regulations) vs risk (its already hammered down).

&lt;p&gt;I think the crypto posts here get lots of skepticism as an investment, but keep your eye on the companies built on top of the blockchain because the  really smart VC people are heavily behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

Has anyone seen analysis that looks at a company's valuation today (pre-scale) and compared it to long-term sell-side estimates/expectations?

The gist of the Unhedged article is basically that Adobe has achieved scale but does not get a premium valuation. Obviously that's because their long-term growth rate will be lower now because they're so large.

But the framework is interesting, because if you had a TAM in mind 10 years ago for Adobe and believed they'd achieve scale, you can then basically model out your long-term expected returns sensitizing to varying TAM sizes.

AT&amp;T is reportedly moving ahead with its plan to sell DirecTV  despite receiving bids that value the satellite division at less than  one-third of the price AT&amp;T paid for it.

AT&amp;T bought DirecTV for $49 billion in 2015 and has lost seven  million TV subscribers in the last two years. In late August, news broke  that [AT&amp;T is trying to sell DirecTV](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/08/att-reportedly-trying-to-sell-directv-after-massive-customer-losses/) to private-equity investors and that a deal could come in at less than $20 billion.

The New York Post yesterday [provided an update on the sale process](https://nypost.com/2020/10/06/att-pushes-ahead-with-auction-of-directv-despite-lowball-bids/),  writing that AT&amp;T is pressing ahead with an auction even though it  is ""shaping up to be a fire sale."" The sale process is being handled for  AT&amp;T by Goldman Sachs.

""Opening bids from a coterie of buyout firms came in at around 3.5 times DirecTV's roughly $4.5 billion of [EBITDA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp),  implying a valuation at around $15.75 billion, according to a source  close to the process,"" the Post article said. Despite the low  first-round bids, AT&amp;T ""last week invited a handful of suitors into  the second round of an auction of the struggling satellite-TV  broadcaster,"" the Post wrote. Dish Network did not submit a bid, the  Post wrote, even though Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen [has said](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/02/dish-calls-directv-merger-inevitable-because-of-threat-from-streaming-tv/) that a merger of the two satellite companies is ""probably inevitable."" A DirecTV/Dish merger would face antitrust scrutiny.

Private-equity firms ""are looking to milk the shrinking company for  cash as DirecTV's subscribers steadily flee to lower-priced  streaming-video services like Netflix,"" the Post wrote. AT&amp;T could  retain a minority stake in DirecTV after a sale. We contacted AT&amp;T  about the report and will update this article if we get a response.

## “Serious destruction of value”

""It is very, very surprising they would sell DirecTV at such a low  price—that's a serious destruction of value,"" a former AT&amp;T  executive told the Post. But it isn't surprising that no one wants to  buy DirecTV at anything close to the price AT&amp;T paid five years ago,  because the company has been reporting big customer losses each quarter  for the past couple of years. After a [Q2 2020 loss](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/07/atts-epic-directv-losses-mount-as-another-954000-video-customers-flee/) of 954,000 customers, [AT&amp;T was down to 18.41 million customers](https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2020/q2-2020/q2-2020-investor-briefing.pdf)  across DirecTV, U-verse TV, and AT&amp;T-branded online TV services.  That's a loss of more than 7 million customers since mid-2018 when  AT&amp;T had [25.45 million subscribers](https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2020/q2-2020/2q20-trending-schedule.pdf) in those categories.

DirecTV would likely be losing customers in any circumstance because  of the trend toward cheaper online-streaming services, but AT&amp;T has  accelerated the decline by imposing [price increases](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/12/att-raises-directv-prices-again-despite-losing-millions-of-customers/)  and reducing use of promotional offers that lower monthly costs for  customers. AT&amp;T is trying to improve its TV fortunes with the [$15-per-month HBO Max](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/hbo-max-impressions-the-blockbuster-video-of-streaming-not-a-compliment/), a result of [AT&amp;T's 2018 acquisition](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/06/what-to-expect-now-that-att-officially-owns-time-warner/) of Time Warner Inc. for $85 billion (or $108 billion including Time Warner's debt).

The purchases of DirecTV and Time Warner dramatically increased  AT&amp;T's debt load. Under pressure from investors, AT&amp;T in October  2019 promised to conduct a ""disciplined review"" of its portfolio and  swore off ""[major acquisitions](https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2019/3q-2019/ATT%203Q19%20Earnings%20Release.pdf)"" for three years. AT&amp;T's long-term debt was $153.4 billion [as of June 30, 2020](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/atnt2/sec/sec-show.aspx?FilingId=14312731&amp;Cik=0000732717&amp;Type=PDF&amp;hasPdf=1), down from [$168.5 billion in mid-2018](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/atnt2/sec/sec-show.aspx?FilingId=12891975&amp;Cik=0000732717&amp;Type=PDF&amp;hasPdf=1).",t2_c5hyu,False,,0,False,AT&amp;T offloading DirecTV could be a “fire sale” as company weighs low bids,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_j7ecs5,False,dark,0.84,,public,34,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,34,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1602197243.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/10/att-offloading-directv-could-be-a-fire-sale-as-company-weighs-low-bids/""&gt;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/10/att-offloading-directv-could-be-a-fire-sale-as-company-weighs-low-bids/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is reportedly moving ahead with its plan to sell DirecTV  despite receiving bids that value the satellite division at less than  one-third of the price AT&amp;amp;T paid for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T bought DirecTV for $49 billion in 2015 and has lost seven  million TV subscribers in the last two years. In late August, news broke  that &lt;a href=""https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/08/att-reportedly-trying-to-sell-directv-after-massive-customer-losses/""&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is trying to sell DirecTV&lt;/a&gt; to private-equity investors and that a deal could come in at less than $20 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York Post yesterday &lt;a href=""https://nypost.com/2020/10/06/att-pushes-ahead-with-auction-of-directv-despite-lowball-bids/""&gt;provided an update on the sale process&lt;/a&gt;,  writing that AT&amp;amp;T is pressing ahead with an auction even though it  is &amp;quot;shaping up to be a fire sale.&amp;quot; The sale process is being handled for  AT&amp;amp;T by Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Opening bids from a coterie of buyout firms came in at around 3.5 times DirecTV&amp;#39;s roughly $4.5 billion of &lt;a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp""&gt;EBITDA&lt;/a&gt;,  implying a valuation at around $15.75 billion, according to a source  close to the process,&amp;quot; the Post article said. Despite the low  first-round bids, AT&amp;amp;T &amp;quot;last week invited a handful of suitors into  the second round of an auction of the struggling satellite-TV  broadcaster,&amp;quot; the Post wrote. Dish Network did not submit a bid, the  Post wrote, even though Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen &lt;a href=""https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/02/dish-calls-directv-merger-inevitable-because-of-threat-from-streaming-tv/""&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt; that a merger of the two satellite companies is &amp;quot;probably inevitable.&amp;quot; A DirecTV/Dish merger would face antitrust scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private-equity firms &amp;quot;are looking to milk the shrinking company for  cash as DirecTV&amp;#39;s subscribers steadily flee to lower-priced  streaming-video services like Netflix,&amp;quot; the Post wrote. AT&amp;amp;T could  retain a minority stake in DirecTV after a sale. We contacted AT&amp;amp;T  about the report and will update this article if we get a response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;“Serious destruction of value”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is very, very surprising they would sell DirecTV at such a low  price—that&amp;#39;s a serious destruction of value,&amp;quot; a former AT&amp;amp;T  executive told the Post. But it isn&amp;#39;t surprising that no one wants to  buy DirecTV at anything close to the price AT&amp;amp;T paid five years ago,  because the company has been reporting big customer losses each quarter  for the past couple of years. After a &lt;a href=""https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/07/atts-epic-directv-losses-mount-as-another-954000-video-customers-flee/""&gt;Q2 2020 loss&lt;/a&gt; of 954,000 customers, &lt;a href=""https://investors.att.com/%7E/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2020/q2-2020/q2-2020-investor-briefing.pdf""&gt;AT&amp;amp;T was down to 18.41 million customers&lt;/a&gt;  across DirecTV, U-verse TV, and AT&amp;amp;T-branded online TV services.  That&amp;#39;s a loss of more than 7 million customers since mid-2018 when  AT&amp;amp;T had &lt;a href=""https://investors.att.com/%7E/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2020/q2-2020/2q20-trending-schedule.pdf""&gt;25.45 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; in those categories.&lt;/p&gt;

Payments company Square has invested $50 million into Bitcoin, according to an announcement today. It has bought 4,709 Bitcoin, with one percent of the company's assets. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; “We believe that Bitcoin has the potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future,” said Square’s chief financial officer, Amrita Ahuja. “As it grows in adoption, we intend to learn and participate in a disciplined way. For a company that is building products based on a more inclusive future, this investment is a step on that journey.” 

Square is owned by Jack Dorsey, **the CEO of Twitter** (and enthusiastic Bitcoin advocate). Square also owns CashApp, which has been offering Bitcoin for some time now. Dorsey has previously said that he regularly maxes out the weekly Bitcoin buy limits on CashApp. 

Square has been investing in crypto for some time. It set up Square Crypto in March 2019 to support the development of the Bitcoin network. It has handed out a number of grants to Bitcoin developers and companies working in the space. 

This investment follows business intelligence firm MicroStrategy buying $200 million of Bitcoin as an investment, before buying another $175 million of Bitcoin.

,investing," **What is Happening?**

Activist investor Dan Loeb is urging Disney to permanently suspend its dividend and use the funds to fuel growth at its streaming service, Disney+. Disney stock traded up 1.64% Wednesday. Loeb's Third Point owns less than 1% of Disney. 

*Activist investors acquire stakes in companies with the intent to bring operational change. Warren Buffett started out as an activist investor.* 

**Why does this Matter?**

Disney's stock is down 16% for the year as amusement parks are still slow to reopen due to restrictions. Also, last week Disney announced that it was laying off 28,000 workers, wiping out about a quarter of its U.S. theme-park workforce.   


Right now the company's only bright spot is Disney+. It attracted more than 60 million subscribers and even won praise from the likes of Netflix CEO Reed Hastings.   


Loeb would like to use the $3 billion Disney dividend to double Disney+'s budget for original content, bring in additional subscribers, lower churn, and boost pricing power. He would also like to see Disney combine Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu, and Star into one powerhouse streaming service. That way Disney could increase pricing and start releasing all movies on the platform, cutting out movie theaters completely.   


**The Takeaway:**

Dividends are just one way a company can choose to ""allocate capital/profits"". As Loeb correctly points out, times are changing in the entertainment sector and Disney should capitalize on that by redirecting dividends to this high growth project. In the long-run, such a capital allocation decision might just reward shareholders a lot more than the 1.46% dividend. ",t2_7x8oypts,False,,0,False,Activist investor Dan Loeb urges Disney to suspend dividend and redirect the funds to its streaming service Disney+.,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_j7dpsp,False,dark,0.96,,public,1408,3,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1408,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1602195021.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Happening?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activist investor Dan Loeb is urging Disney to permanently suspend its dividend and use the funds to fuel growth at its streaming service, Disney+. Disney stock traded up 1.64% Wednesday. Loeb&amp;#39;s Third Point owns less than 1% of Disney. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Activist investors acquire stakes in companies with the intent to bring operational change. Warren Buffett started out as an activist investor.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does this Matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney&amp;#39;s stock is down 16% for the year as amusement parks are still slow to reopen due to restrictions. Also, last week Disney announced that it was laying off 28,000 workers, wiping out about a quarter of its U.S. theme-park workforce.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now the company&amp;#39;s only bright spot is Disney+. It attracted more than 60 million subscribers and even won praise from the likes of Netflix CEO Reed Hastings.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loeb would like to use the $3 billion Disney dividend to double Disney+&amp;#39;s budget for original content, bring in additional subscribers, lower churn, and boost pricing power. He would also like to see Disney combine Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu, and Star into one powerhouse streaming service. That way Disney could increase pricing and start releasing all movies on the platform, cutting out movie theaters completely.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Initially, it might seem scary to take away that 1.43% dividend yield from shareholders; however, Loeb is not completely crazy. Dividends are just one way a company can choose to &amp;quot;allocate capital/profits&amp;quot;. As Loeb correctly points out, times are changing in the entertainment sector and Disney should capitalize on that by redirecting dividends to this high growth project. In the long-run, such a capital allocation decision might just reward shareholders a lot more than the 1.46% dividend. &lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Hi everyone. 

First off, thanks for stopping by to check out my post. 

I’d like to share a little bit about PIC, which will be merging with XL Fleet (ticker will be XL) sometime in the 4th quarter. 

I have been playing SPAC’s since I started investing/trading 7 months ago like a lot of people. What I have found most interesting with PIC, is not that it is a green play, or that they convert existing vehicles on the road to hybrids, or that they have actual products on the road already with revenue to hit $75M next year, but the idea that the stock is currently valued at its “pre-merger” announcement price. 

The stock is at 10.50 as I type this up. 

As far as SPAC’s have gone lately, they are on a slow bleed the last two weeks or so. PIC, and the XL announcement, came at a bad time for these plays, three weeks ago. The stock only spiked to $13 and change, and has slowly fallen back to where it is now. 

Here’s the DD as I see it. XL Fleet has FedEx, DHL, Pepsi, and Verizon lined up and is hoping to have to 100,000 vehicle installs in the next 18 months. These powertrains get added into Ford and Chevy vehicles, instantly transforming them into hybrids and can save companies money. 

Green tech tends to be hot now, PIC is at a total bargain, and XL Fleet had an actual product, on the roads, and ready to go. 

I hope this helps some of you, and my position is long at 1,200 shares at 11.29 average. I have averaged down from my initial purchase at 12.50. 

Here is a link to more info as well.

Thanks for checking this out.

&lt;p&gt;First off, thanks for stopping by to check out my post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to share a little bit about PIC, which will be merging with XL Fleet (ticker will be XL) sometime in the 4th quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been playing SPAC’s since I started investing/trading 7 months ago like a lot of people. What I have found most interesting with PIC, is not that it is a green play, or that they convert existing vehicles on the road to hybrids, or that they have actual products on the road already with revenue to hit $75M next year, but the idea that the stock is currently valued at its “pre-merger” announcement price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stock is at 10.50 as I type this up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as SPAC’s have gone lately, they are on a slow bleed the last two weeks or so. PIC, and the XL announcement, came at a bad time for these plays, three weeks ago. The stock only spiked to $13 and change, and has slowly fallen back to where it is now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the DD as I see it. XL Fleet has FedEx, DHL, Pepsi, and Verizon lined up and is hoping to have to 100,000 vehicle installs in the next 18 months. These powertrains get added into Ford and Chevy vehicles, instantly transforming them into hybrids and can save companies money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green tech tends to be hot now, PIC is at a total bargain, and XL Fleet had an actual product, on the roads, and ready to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps some of you, and my position is long at 1,200 shares at 11.29 average. I have averaged down from my initial purchase at 12.50. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a link to more info as well. &lt;/p&gt;

I have practiced for a while in the WT (can't spell it out in here, but I guess most of you know what who I am talking about here) Sterling Trader Pro Simulator and am planning to make the move to a real broker soon.

This suggests that the vast majority of corporate debt does not appear to be at risk of default in the near term.

,investing,"A few interesting things I'm seeing in their financial statements:  


\-Gross margins are strong and have little variation between then for the years 2011-2020. The company can make money in their sleep because what they do is profitable (closeout retail). Revenue growth is profitable and they have a large store foot print of 1,400+ stores. Usually in lower income areas and you can see this by the growth of shrink (inventory theft) as the company expands their store footprint.

\-SGA has grown faster than EBIT margins. EBIT margins have never been higher than SGA growth. So it's not a business issue but may be a corporate issue?  


\-They've bought back an aggressive amount of stock over the past ten years. When you look at how fast the company has bought back stock and decided to pay a dividend as well it does give the first impression that management is very shareholder friendly. We do love buybacks and dividends. But they've reduced their shares outstanding at the expense of increasing their debt levels. Total liabilities have grown over 14% over the last ten years. Buybacks lower the cost of equity to a degree but now the company seems to be slowly growing more dependent on debt.

\-They've had some annoying accounting moments such as discontinued operations when KB Toys went bankrupt years ago. They also sold off a distribution center in CA last year and relocated it to Apple Valley, CA. That gain on sale was 53% of their 2020 EBIT. Pull that out and EBIT crashed hard in 2020. And even if you do leave that gain on sale in you have to ask yourself how they're going make that sale happen again. You can't sell the same building twice.

\-Management links executive performance bonuses to ROIC improvements. I get worried quickly when I see companies talk about ROIC because ROIC, like EBITDA, is a non-GAAP metric. When I read Southwest Airlines' 10-K (pre-2020) they included a calculation for ROIC there that the company uses. At best I just ignore it and see it as pandering to shareholders because we care about ROIC growth. At worst I think it's the company trying to tie themselves to more non-GAAP metrics for compensation. Non-GAAP metrics that can stuffed.

\-Adjust for buybacks (I did this by looking through the footnotes to find the amount of shares they bought back and added it back to their outstanding share count for the year in question, and adding back the cash spent on buybacks to shareholders equity). And the capital base has grown faster than EPS and FCF. FCF also has to be adjusted a bit because of how their CFFI section handled acquisitions in the past and PPE sales as well. So what I ended up doing was CFFO-capex+PPE sales-acquisitions. Then I calculated just CFFO-capex-acquisitions. Pick either FCF calculation and the capital base has still grown faster than that. 

\-DSI (calculated as ending inventory divided by cost of goods sold multiplied by 365 days as I was using the 10-K documents for all of this) has grown from 51 days in 2011 to 63 days in 2020. It was at 67 days in 2019. Now this may be justifiable because they make a lot of their money from furniture and home decor sales and there's only so many buyers that go to Big Lots that can afford furniture on a predictable basis. But this growth has me worried that they don't know how to manage inventories properly. 2020 isn't going to help that either because their buying base more than likely lacks cash to decorate their homes. So what can they do if their debt load continues to grow in light of potential closures occurring again? Debt will grow (leases and accrued expenses especially) but smaller revenues so will they do consignment sales to get inventory down? Will they cut prices at their stores? Will they do a capital raise and dilute shareholders even more? I don't know and that's what makes this difficult.

\-Management: Bruce Thorn, the former CEO of Tailored Brands, left TB to go to Big Lots. Now I'm not going to act as though Tailored Brands going into bankruptcy was all on him. That's not fair of anyone to say since nobody could predict COVID or Amazon having taken over almost all of the retail world. But I do have to take note that he probably saw a lot of the issues Tailored Brands have and was unable to stop them, leading to their ultimate bankruptcy. I can't just ignore that.

,investing,"TL;DR summary:

*For most of the past 40 years, Nelnet (NYSE:NNI) has kept a low profile as a Federal student loans service provider. While it still represents cca. 30% of their revenue, a termination of their contract with the Department of Education headed by Betsy DeVos, as announced on April’02 this year, might be the best thing that happened to this company.*

This should get validated (or flop) by 12/18/2020. I am looking at several dimensions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Fundamentals:** We talk about finance, education, payment, communications and more.
2. **Technical analysis:** We take a look at the recent price action and market response.
3. **Catalyst**: The mindset compounder.
4. **Timeframe**: Q4 2020 followed by multi-year allocation.
5. **Execution**: This will include trade, triggers, target price and return-on-capital projections.

,investing,"Okay, I've been out of pocket the last few days and got to this one late, since there wasn't a lot of actual mod opinion/representation in that thread I've removed it and I'm starting one where we can actually express our views/stance.  The thread is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/j6c9hv/can_we_stop_locking_investment_related_threads/) should you wish to access it.  There's just no need for two meta threads in the same day, and the answer to the complaint is ""no"" anyway. 

I'm lifting this mostly from a comment I made there, but here's our general stance: 

&gt; In the end I honestly think there is quite a bit of disconnect between the community and the mod team.

This probably won't be a popular opinion but this is both true and a new thing.  I've made no secret that I don't like what Reddit has become.  They have vastly expanded their cross sub algorithms, and Reddit as a whole has grown, given recent events this sub has seen an almost doubling in size over the last two years.    

I'm going to be direct because I'm not particularly worried about being popular here: **the vast majority of the new subscribers are not investors, have very little interest in investing, and don't have any background in investing.**  This is painfully obvious in that joke threads, off topic comments, etc are constantly the top voted comments in any given large thread.  So because they have no real interest in investing their comments tend to basically be the same as if they were in any given general news/politics/whatever subreddit.  Think about how much of the discussion in /r/economics or /r/technology has to do with economics or technology.  Is there a disconnect between the mod team and those users?  sure.  That's fine by me.   

If you want an investment community where the top comment on AAPL earnings thread is someone's comment about how they like their iphone because of imessage then yes, there is going to be  a disconnect between this sub's moderation team and you.  That isn't an /r/investing mod team problem, that is a subscriber issue.  

There seems to be this growing attitude on Reddit that subreddits are some democratic entity where users can override moderation if there's enough popularity.  That is not an accurate representation of how a sub is run, and should that be the case it would just quickly turn in to ""vaguely economic/public company related general discussion"" and not ""discussion on investing in capital markets and securities"".  This may be tough for some people to hear but as far as Reddit is structurally concerned a subreddit is an independent forum owned and controlled by it's moderators.     

So just to be clear: the policies in place, and the actions we take, are purposefully crafted to discourage people like the above from posting here.  I'm a blunt person as many of you know, I won't beat around the bush here; one regular contributor that actually discusses investing is more important to us than 1,000 subscribers who don't like our policies.  We are not catering to people who want to discuss anything they desire, and if they're upset by this then I apologize but there are other subreddits.  This is a place dedicated to investment discussion, you don't need to be a professional, expert, whatever to post here.  But you do need to discuss investing.  This is an extremely low bar, but in many cases hat bar is not being met. 

**Thread Locks**: if an entire thread is just political bickering, or off topic discussion it's getting locked.  We're not interested in micromanaging discussion, we are interested in just locking threads when people can't stay on topic.  I personally think it's a bit ridiculous that people expect mods to babysit a thread rather than just lock it when people can't stay on topic.  If people can't stay on topic that really tells us the thread probably isn't super relevant anyway.  And simply removing comments on a 500+ comment thread on the front page, where we average 300,000 pageviews per day and 100,000 unique pageviews per day, is trying to plug the hoover dam with Spez's dick.  It's an effort in futility.  

**Politics**: We used to discuss politics all the time, the choice to ban that was directly due to user behavior.  At some point after 2018 commenting here shifted from investment relevant opinions to something that can only be described as a debate between the lead editors for Bretbart and Vox, but dumber.  Compare [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/40usw0/bernie_sanders_002_percent_financial_transactions/) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4a771n/bernie_sanders_proposed_tax_on_wall_street/) four years ago to [this thread last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cmyr9q/bernie_sanders_proposes_tax_of_under_onehalf/), both on the same exact subject.  As you can plainly tell the older one is far more topic centric than the newer one.    

Point is this forum is for investment discussion.  Politics and capital markets are certainly intertwined, but inevitably the new posters here are unable to discuss capital markets and just start talking about any given political opinion they have; then we get a thread indistinguishable from /r/politics.  If an entire thread is discussing the market ramifications of political regimes/policy then it's welcome here, that hasn't been the case in almost any thread over the last two years.  The 60 day bans for this sort of off topic behavior are deliberate in their length to encourage those people to find another subreddit to participate in.  ""I think Trump's proposal is bad for markets because of XYZ"" is totally relevant, ""I think Trump is a fat bad old man who hates minorities"" is totally a non relevant comment.  You may think it's true or false depending on which politics team you're on, but if you can't understand that it's irrelevant to investing then you shouldn't comment here. 


Our goal is fostering good investment discussion.  The goal is not to be a platform for political soapboxing, airing out grievances about corporations, have broad general discussion, or whatever else people want to do here.  That is not to say politics, corporate grievances, etc aren't important.  They're not part of this subreddit's purpose.  

Our goals also have nothing to do with activity, subscribers, or views/whatever.  The only thing we want is discussion that actually has to do with investing, and not whatever other subject people wish to try and relate back to investing.  If that means a bunch of people not here to discuss investing get mad and unsubscribe then that's a win.  To be frank many of our most knowledgeable regulars have stopped coming here because of the degradation in quality over the last two years.  This is not a condition we are happy with nor one we'd want to support.  

&gt;From my experience talking to them it seems like a few senior mods have a very strong vision of what this sub should and should not be, and the quality of mods they are looking to recruit isn’t easy to come by.

Mods make a sub.  I think we're pretty open that we don't want a bunch of mods that want to make a sub that's just some lightly moderated general discussion outlet.  We want mods to come from our pool of regular quality contributors, not someone who's interested in being a mod for mod's sake, and not someone who mods a dozen other places.  The point is to have people in charge of something where they have vested interest in the quality of the sub.  I would absolutely love to add another 30 mods tomorrow, I can't think of anyone who wants the job and is also a good candidate but feel free to shoot us a modmail if you think you fit the bill.  I'd say this, if at least one of our existing mods doesn't recognize your username then it's probably gonna be a no.  

Here's the thing, if people don't like the rules then there are hundreds of other subreddits.  There's dozens of subreddits for politics, you can go over to /r/economics to see what a sub looks like when the mods aren't worried about removing low effort political discussion, and if that's appealing to you then you can comment there.  You can go to /r/latestagecapitalism or dozens of other subreddits if you just want to complain about public companies.  You can go to your political subreddit of choice for political discussion.  So again all of the new subscribers complaining about our efforts to remove those things don't really sway us, because we're not here for you and you have other outlets.  So we're not preventing anyone from having any sort of discussion they want to have, we're saying this isn't the sub for it.       

And finally if you would like to go to a subreddit for general discussion of **investing your money in to capital markets and securities** then you can hang here.  If ya want to talk shit about your least favorite corporation or politician then I think I speak for the entire mod team in saying we would prefer you went elsewhere.    

So TLDR: we have zero interest in creating a sub that allows for general off topic discussion, general political discussion, low effort political banter, or any of the other low effort joke/pun/anecdotes/whatever that you see across the majority of large subs.  This sub doesn't need to be all things to all people, and we have no interest in allowing more off topic conversation just because new users want it.  And if that means a sizeable portion of the subscribers, especially the more recent ones, are upset then that is a condition we are fine with.  The bar for discussion here is not high, it's literally just ""actually talk about investing"", so any degree of blowback concerning anyone on our team's moderation is really met by a high degree of cynicism from me given how broad that guideline is.",t2_p8vmm,False,,0,False,"[Meta Thread] Re: ""can the mods stop locking threads""",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_j6tktn,False,dark,0.86,,public,326,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,326,,False,,1602088753.0,,[],{},,True,,1602115446.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, I&amp;#39;ve been out of pocket the last few days and got to this one late, since there wasn&amp;#39;t a lot of actual mod opinion/representation in that thread I&amp;#39;ve removed it and I&amp;#39;m starting one where we can actually express our views/stance.

,investing,"**Background**  
I had worked on the trading floor of a sell-side firm, but not in any sales, trading or research capacity. The division I was part of is engaged in all activities related to capital markets: equity sales, equity trading, equity research, bond trading, investment banking, etc. I had built, integrated, and managed the software they use for most of their business activities.

**The equity sell-side cycle: equity research team**  
This team consists of research analysts with 1 or 2 associates assigned to each of them, and is the cost center of the business. At its core, the analysts initiate stock ratings (ie buy, sell, hold) and price targets, and regularly publish research articles for distribution by the sales team, trading team, and CRM-maintained email distribution lists to the buy-side clients for pre-earnings, post-earnings, and any otherwise large moves in the stock. These articles are distributed for free with the intent of building rapport between the buy-side and the analyst, for future upselling. Each analyst owns a specific vertical (ie technology, healthcare, financials, etc) and maintains the theses on the stocks in his coverage universe, meanwhile a much lower-compensated associate performs most of the heavy lifting to collect data and elaborate on the thesis.

The analyst would often travel to specific cities or regions to meet with buy-side clients in their corporate offices in order to discuss their stock ratings. Because of stringent financial regulations around how a buy-side client may compensate for sell-side services (due to concerns over breach of fiduciary duty, unjustifiable high maintenance fees, etc) and the overwhelming paperwork involved in documenting gifts, services, or meals provided by the buy-side, the sell-side firm pays for all travel and meals. For a satisfied buy-side client to compensate for the services provided, they would send trade desk flows to our trading desk which is fulfilled via dark pools and phone calls; the public exchange is a last resort if the buy-side client updates the order for imminent execution.

**The equity sell-side cycle: equity trading team**  
Traders execute trades submitted to them by buy-side clients as an upsold service for the value provided by the analyst. They live in and stare at the Bloomberg terminal from sun up to market close. They do not trade after-hours, and they do not often hold the shares on their books if they can help it. This is how your broker typically operates, by finding the other side of the trade. On the rare occasion that the trader does decide to fulfill the trade on the books, an accompanying options position is initiated to hedge the delta; the options position depends on imminent risks on the event horizon.

Unlike the equity research team, traders are assigned to accounts which means they own the order flow for that account and receive a part of the commission for trade execution. They tend to have a good idea who's a buyer and seller at certain levels. On some occasions, the trader will have to cooperate with another in-house trader in order to find the other side of the order. In such ideal arrangements, both traders get paid and the firm is happy to be involved in both sides.

Traders rarely travel - and the ones who do travel tend to be in more senior position and would accompany an analyst on his trip in order to talk client relationship, business development, etc.

**The equity sell-side cycle: equity sales team**  
The equity salespeople talk more than anyone else and make most of the noise on the trading floor when a trader is not screaming profanities. Their job is to call new and existing clients and pitch an analyst report. If they do not hook their audience within seconds of the pitch, they have lost the client interest and opinion in the salesperson's value-add. When not pitching analyst reports, the salesperson is pitching meetings with the analyst, meetings with corporate execs at our hosted conferences, private meetings with corporate execs in the client's office to talk the company (NDR, or *non-deal roadshow*) or to raise money through share offerings (DR, or *deal roadshow*). The latter three are *corporate access* services which are highly valued and sought after by the buy-side, and therefore fill up very quickly. Anyone would be lucky to be 1 of the 3 caller questions that a company takes on their quarterly earnings call. These meetings offer the buy-side clients 30-60 minutes of face-to-face with these same executives, and is an opportunity to inform their investment decision in a way that their competitors cannot.

These services are offered for free upfront, and are indirectly compensated for via trade desk flow.

**How it all comes together, and why the game is rigged**  
If you have asked yourself any of the following questions while reading this, then you're starting to get the bigger picture:

* Why would the CEO of a publicly traded company travel with our research analyst instead of another analyst from another firm?
* How are the highly sought-after corporate access events with corporate execs filled or prioritized?
* Why is that most analysts have &gt;90% buy ratings, a few neutral ratings, and only a few to no sell ratings?
* How does this influence the sell-side management to pressure research analysts on their stock theses?

The top priority of the sell-side is to make money. In order to make money, they have to provide a value to the buy-side that makes them money in their investment decisions.

In short, this means that management always pressures the research analysts to initiate buy ratings on stocks (even if they believe these stocks will tank), for the sole purpose of establishing a relationship with the CXO of these companies. A positive relationship means meetings to fill, shares for the trade desk to execute as compensation, and money for the sell-side to keep the cycle going. This is also why sector or industry analysts don't really exist: you can't cozy up to CXOs when you're initiate buy/sell recommendations on ETFs.

The buy-side is not stupid. They understand this business model. However, it's precisely because of this business model that they love sell-side services. Unless you're large holder of the stock, you won't ever get into corporate access (unless it's some undersubscribed small cap). The corporate execs' goal in these meetings is to project confidence and get the buy-side fund to hold/buy more shares to lift the stock.

It is because of this business model that analysts that are often right or often wrong make the most money for the sell-side. In fact, during my time there, our most highly demanded analyst was one who was wrong over 80% of the time, followed by one who was right over 70% of the time. In being wrong almost all the time, this works out great for all parties involved: the research analyst has better corporate penetration because the stock is struggling, which makes it easier to cozy up to CXOs for corporate access events; the CXOs has better access to fund managers to project strength in private meetings; the analyst can be used as a counterweight and the buy-side often does exactly the opposite of each stock buy rating (as evidenced by sell order flows reaching our desk despite the buy ratings). Keep this in mind whenever you following an online tracker for an analyst track record - these guys who always get it wrong often get compensated the most.

On the flipside, sell ratings face heavy internal scrutiny from the sell-side management as they are often viewed as a death sentence for any relationship between the sell-side and corporate execs. Management does not care about the analyst's feelings on the stock - if you like or hate it so much, trade it in your own account is how they see it.

Nevertheless, a sell rating can be viewed as either a strong conviction, or a chess match to flip the corporate exec. Management's strategy would depend on the analyst's track record. For an analyst that is often right, he has more freedom to initiate a sell rating as a strong conviction idea in order to maintain that record which the buy-side values. Otherwise, management may see it fit to initiate a sell rating because Wall Street is saturated with buy ratings and you cannot stand out in the pack by joining the pack. This kind of maneuver is sometimes successful in getting the attention of the CXOs at the company and initiating a conversation in order to flip it into a buy rating, in exchange for some service or corporate access.

**TLDR;** The game is rigged. Don't believe the majority of sell-side analyst ratings. There is a reason why an overwhelming majority of analyst ratings are buy ratings, and it is not just because markets tend to be bullish. They exist predominately to build relationships and upsell services.",t2_5kacynl3,False,,1,False,"A long read on analyst ratings, their motivations, and whether you can trust them",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_j6ckl1,False,dark,0.94,,public,89,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,89,,False,,1602030812.0,,[],{'gid_2': 1},,True,,1602043886.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;li&gt;How are the highly sought-after corporate access events with corporate execs filled or prioritized?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is that most analysts have &amp;gt;90% buy ratings, a few neutral ratings, and only a few to no sell ratings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does this influence the sell-side management to pressure research analysts on their stock theses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top priority of the sell-side is to make money. In order to make money, they have to provide a value to the buy-side that makes them money in their investment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, this means that management always pressures the research analysts to initiate buy ratings on stocks (even if they believe these stocks will tank), for the sole purpose of establishing a relationship with the CXO of these companies. A positive relationship means meetings to fill, shares for the trade desk to execute as compensation, and money for the sell-side to keep the cycle going. This is also why sector or industry analysts don&amp;#39;t really exist: you can&amp;#39;t cozy up to CXOs when you&amp;#39;re initiate buy/sell recommendations on ETFs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The buy-side is not stupid. They understand this business model. However, it&amp;#39;s precisely because of this business model that they love sell-side services. Unless you&amp;#39;re large holder of the stock, you won&amp;#39;t ever get into corporate access (unless it&amp;#39;s some undersubscribed small cap). The corporate execs&amp;#39; goal in these meetings is to project confidence and get the buy-side fund to hold/buy more shares to lift the stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is because of this business model that analysts that are often right or often wrong make the most money for the sell-side. In fact, during my time there, our most highly demanded analyst was one who was wrong over 80% of the time, followed by one who was right over 70% of the time. In being wrong almost all the time, this works out great for all parties involved: the research analyst has better corporate penetration because the stock is struggling, which makes it easier to cozy up to CXOs for corporate access events; the CXOs has better access to fund managers to project strength in private meetings; the analyst can be used as a counterweight and the buy-side often does exactly the opposite of each stock buy rating (as evidenced by sell order flows reaching our desk despite the buy ratings). Keep this in mind whenever you following an online tracker for an analyst track record - these guys who always get it wrong often get compensated the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flipside, sell ratings face heavy internal scrutiny from the sell-side management as they are often viewed as a death sentence for any relationship between the sell-side and corporate execs. Management does not care about the analyst&amp;#39;s feelings on the stock - if you like or hate it so much, trade it in your own account is how they see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, a sell rating can be viewed as either a strong conviction, or a chess match to flip the corporate exec. Management&amp;#39;s strategy would depend on the analyst&amp;#39;s track record. For an analyst that is often right, he has more freedom to initiate a sell rating as a strong conviction idea in order to maintain that record which the buy-side values. Otherwise, management may see it fit to initiate a sell rating because Wall Street is saturated with buy ratings and you cannot stand out in the pack by joining the pack. This kind of maneuver is sometimes successful in getting the attention of the CXOs at the company and initiating a conversation in order to flip it into a buy rating, in exchange for some service or corporate access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR;&lt;/strong&gt; The game is rigged. Don&amp;#39;t believe the majority of sell-side analyst ratings. There is a reason why an overwhelming majority of analyst ratings are buy ratings, and it is not just because markets tend to be bullish. They exist predominately to build relationships and upsell services.&lt;/p&gt;

The Triad Pro eCell is the future of energy storage.  It is a revolutionary storage system that replaces toxic batteries and is eco-friendly.  The eCell stores electricity quickly and charges in minutes.  It requires no maintenance or routine replacement and lasts for decades.

Global demand for renewable battery storage is at an all-time high and emerging rapidly. For many industries, the Triad Pro eCells offer a viable solution for standalone products when partnered with solar acting as the main charge.

Certain industries such as farming, mining, oil production and military currently rely on diesel-generated electricity because they are located in areas where standard grid electricity is unavailable.  Triad Pro's eCell is the solution.

Here is one fully developed practical example:  https://triadproinc.com/spree/

,investing,"I’m a traditional Benjamin Graham (unrelated from this company) and Warren Buffett style value investor. Things I always look for are a competitive advantage, strong management, conservative leverage, strong cash flows, and reasonable valuations. 

One pick that I’ve invested a considerable amount of money into is Graham Holdings (GHC). This company was formerly known as the Washington Post Company before the newspaper was sold to Bezos. GHC currently trades at ~$420 a share and I believe it has asset value between $600-800 (valuation is wider range due to COVID and unknown impairment to the business). 

The company trades on thin volume (low analyst coverage), has very little in ways of investor communication (the chairman is close friends with and learns from Buffett), and is essentially a conglomerate that has two main business lines: education and TV stations. The former is primarily in their business, Kaplan, widely valued at $700 MM - $1 BN. Their TV station business is a cash cow and is valued between $1.5-2.0 BN. They recently spun off their cable TV business, Cable One (CABO) that has quadrupled in value in a few years. This would imply that the value of their current TV business may be even more valuable than my current estimate. Other business lines they have include manufacturing, healthcare, and misc. other businesses (restaurants, etc). In all, their combined asset value equates to $600-800 per share, with $600 being very conservative. 

Management retains a meaningful stake in the business which helps align investors and management decision making, the company has historically been very shareholder friendly (IE, buybacks), and it has no risk of insolvency, meaning investors can wait long periods for a payback. 

One thing to note is that GHC is VERY different from Berkshire, despite common comparisons between the two. Berkshire has a major equity portfolio and invests float from its insurance business (it’s basically free borrowing); GHC has conservative investment strategies like Berkshire, but has no insurance business and has primarily private businesses (note Berkshire has considerable wholly owned businesses as well).

Normally, the VIX ([VIX](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=VIX&amp;source=story_quote_link)) is muted when US stocks are at record highs. But some market analysts grew concerned in recent days because the VIX kept rising — even as the S&amp;P 500 made new highs.In fact, the VIX hit its highest level ever at an all-time high for the S&amp;P 500, according to Bespoke Investment Group and Goldman Sachs. The previous high was set in March 2000 during the dot-com bubble.”It is a significant red flag,” Daryl Jones, director of research at Hedgeye Risk Management, told CNN Business. “The market is at a very risky point. It heightens the risk of a market crash.”

When US stocks rise and the VIX stays low (and often goes lower), that’s typically a green light for investors.”You want to chase that. But higher stock market on higher volatility is telling you that risk is increasing,” Jones said.

All three major indexes finished the day sharply lower. The Nasdaq closed down nearly 5%, and the S&amp;P fell 3.5%, while the Dow finished 2.8%, or 808 points, lower.

So, what happened?

For one, the Nasdaq has been outperforming the other two major stock indexes — the Dow (INDU) and the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) — for months. The rally has been going on for long enough that investors are now taking profit.

Even so, the Nasdaq remains up nearly 28% in 2020, still far outpacing its counterparts. The Dow, which only recently turned positive for the year, is back in the red.

""Although there is no single driver for the weakness, it seems as if investors all of a sudden realized how overbought stocks are and sold. Someone yelled fire in a crowded theater and everyone left at once,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, in emailed comments.

But there are also technical reasons for Thursday's decline: As US-China relations sour, investors are moving money out of tech, which could get hit the hardest from a potential increase in tariffs.

""The Nasdaq is getting hit hard with the continued rotation into cyclicals and expectations big-tech will ultimately pay the cost to a further deterioration with US-Chinese relations,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.

Stocks in cyclical sectors are expected to perform better as the economy is recovering.

The Big Tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), all of which are part of the Nasdaq, have become the safe-haven investment of the summer. But investors have beginning to wonder when the rally will run out of steam, either because of increased regulation or because the economy as a whole picks up enough to void the need for safety picks altogether.

Key Excerpts:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Justice Department plans to bring an antitrust case against Google as soon as this month, after Attorney General William P. Barr overruled career lawyers who said they needed more time to build a strong case against one of the world’s wealthiest, most formidable technology companies, according to five people briefed on internal department conversations.  
&gt;  
&gt;Justice Department officials told lawyers involved in the antitrust inquiry into Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, to wrap up their work by the end of September, according to three of the people. Most of the 40-odd lawyers who had been working on the investigation opposed the deadline. Some said they would not sign the complaint, and several of them left the case this summer.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Brianna Herlihy, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment on the continuing investigation. Jose Castaneda, a spokesman for Google, said that the company would “continue to engage with ongoing investigations” and that its business practices enabled “increased choice and competition.”

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Justice Department amassed powerful evidence of anticompetitive practices, three people said.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the lawyers also described internal politics that at times slowed down the department’s work or drove a wedge among members of the team.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For nearly a year, dozens of Justice Department lawyers and other staff members worked in two groups, each overseeing a separate line of inquiry: Google’s dominance in search and its control over many aspects of the ecosystem for online advertising.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Google controls about 90 percent of web searches globally, and rivals have complained that the company extended its dominance by making its search and browsing tools defaults on phones with its Android operating system. Google also captures about one-third of every dollar spent on online advertising, and its ad tools are used to supply and auction ads that appear across the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech seems to have picked up with Google in the Trump Administrations crosshairs.

,investing,"For many years, I have been an advocate of the Three-Fund Portfolio and, in general, the Boglehead approach to investing.  Roughly 90% of my portfolio still exists in this format, with an allocation of 61% domestic, 14% international, and 25% bond.

Recently, I built up a model of all of my finances:

* ""static"" expenses (things that don't increase over time, like mortgage payments, student loan payments, and auto payments)
* ""dynamic"" expense (those that do increase over time with inflation, like daycare, property tax, and the electric bill
* Income, with a metric for annual increases
* Investments, with allocation, historical yield, and standard deviation

All of this was set to answer the question: ""When am I likely to be able to retire?""  The finish line would be based on the logic: 25 times the amount of ($100,000/year inflation adjusted plus any remaining ""static"" expenses).  So if the mortgage was the only expense left and you pay $50k a year on that, my target would be $150k * 25 = $3,750,000.  That allows me to pull 4% per year more or less forever.

The model was run on a monthly basis, proceeding until the mark is hit, stores the retirement age, and then repeats 10,000 times.  Each month, the monthly return is calculated for each investment vehicle by generating a normally distributed random number, multiplying that by the fund's standard deviation, and adding it to the weighted mean return.  In this way, I include all of the random walk of the market.

When putting in the numbers, something drastic stood out to me:

Fund|Annual Return|Standard Deviation
:-:|:-:|:-:
Domestic|7.84%|19.48%
International|4.27%|15.20%
Bond|5.28%|3.07%

Why the hell do I have any money in the international fund?  While not a ""complete"" data set, the International Fund source data is back to 1996, so it's a reasonable 24-year sample.  Yields are lower than bonds, with standard deviation 5x as high.

,investing,"Is there a ""best practice"" or at least a resource for good information regarding corporate actions like tender offers?

In general the legal wording make it difficult and time consuming to decipher

For example the latest tender offer from Ponos to owners of AT&amp;T (ticker: T) where it sounds like they are offering a premium of 20% ($36 compared to current price $30) but researching further I found below article clarifying that accepting the offer can only lead to loss because it will only take effect if the price is above $36 when it expires...

[https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/AT-T-INC-14324/news/AT-T-Recommends-Stockholders-Reject-Mini-Tender-Offer-from-Ponos-Industries-LLC-30780426/](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/AT-T-INC-14324/news/AT-T-Recommends-Stockholders-Reject-Mini-Tender-Offer-from-Ponos-Industries-LLC-30780426/)

So the questions I hope you can assist with are

1. What do you do in general with corporate actions to avoid mis steps or excessive time spent?
2. Why are mini-offers like above with guaranteed loss even legal?
   1. Digging deeper it seems that Ponos has done the exact same on Exxon, Visa, GE, Oracle and Verizon!

From my understanding, the original purpose of investing in companies was to get a portion of their profits (aka in the form of dividends). For a long time now dividends have become negligible and you basically want the company to grow so you can resell the stock at a higher price based on perceived value (very little fundamentals).

China is planning a sweeping set of new government policies to develop its domestic semiconductor industry and counter Trump administration restrictions, conferring the same kind of priority on the effort it accorded to building its atomic capability, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Beijing is preparing broad support for so-called third-generation semiconductors for the five years through 2025, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing government deliberations. A suite of measures to bolster research, education and financing for the industry has been added to a draft of the country’s 14th five-year plan, which will be presented to the country’s top leaders in October, the people said.


China’s top leaders will gather next month to lay out their economic strategy for the next half decade, including efforts to ramp up domestic consumption and make critical technology at home. President Xi Jinping has pledged an estimated $1.4 trillion through 2025 for technologies ranging from wireless networks to artificial intelligence. Semiconductors are fundamental to virtually every component of China’s technology ambitions -- and an increasingly aggressive Trump administration threatens to cut off their supply from abroad.

“The Chinese leadership realizes that semiconductors underpin all advanced technologies, and that it can no longer dependably rely on American supplies,” said Dan Wang, technology analyst at research firm Gavekal Dragonomics. “In the face of stricter U.S. restrictions on chip access, China’s response can only be to keep pushing its own industry to develop.”

It’s been shown that small cap value tends to outperform any other stock asset class over the long term. But the last 10 years or so have been horrible for value investors. I know past performance doesn’t indicate anything for the future, but 10 years of underperformance is horrible if your investment horizon to really grow your wealth is 30 - 40 years.

Why not just hold a blended fund to guarantee yourself you will capture the size effect and not make any effort to tilt one way towards value or growth? By holding a blended fund you guarantee yourself the average of the small caps as a whole. When growth does well, you’ll benefit. When value does well, you’ll benefit. But if you bet on only value and it does poorly, you’ll suffer. I’ve heard small cap, low profitability, growth, has tended to reduce the size effect, but hasn’t value done that for the last decade? 

Since we cannot predict the future, we should seek to capture the average return of the stock market by holding the entire market. If we wish to take on added risk by overweighting certain parts of the market to increase our expected return, why not seek the average of those areas as well?

SalesForce (CRM); bought a $5.90/270 call for September 11th. Sold for 14.30  
\-This was a momentum play, and one I do quite often. I had done a similar 300% trade last week, playing it off earnings. Healthy consolidation and bull volume keep this stock in a safe uptrend.

CrowdStrike (CRWD); I had bought two calls for this play, based on the pop Monday morning. Just like other Covid stocks, CRWD had momentum leading into its earnings date. Bought a $6.30/150 call for September 11th that I sold for $16.05. The other call is a long dated, out of the money, play that I will keep you updated on!

Ride-hailing firm Uber has stepped up lobbying of the Hong Kong government after losing a critical court case on the legality of its business model, with some drivers vowing to keep carrying passengers despite the threat of an intensified crackdown.
In a letter to stakeholders, legislators and other policymakers on Tuesday, Uber’s local head of public policy and government affairs called on them to use their influence to persuade the government to change its stance on the company.
“As we face this critical and uncertain period, I hope that we can continue to count on your support so that Uber and our partners can carry on serving the millions of Hongkongers who rely on our apps,” Richard Wilder said.
“There are different ways that individuals can support Uber at this point, either by raising the issue with relevant stakeholders as you see fit or by submitting to the chief executive’s policy address consultation directly.”

The plea came after the Court of Final Appeal on Tuesday threw out the last-ditch bids of 24 Uber drivers who were found guilty of carrying passengers for hire or reward without a hire-car permit, and were fined between HK$3,000 (US$380) and HK$4,500 in 2018.
The defeat was a devastating blow to Uber, which has provided millions of trips to residents since arriving in 2014, as well as delivering food orders.
“We are extremely disappointed with the court’s decision, and we will continue to support the 24 partners and their families during this challenging time,” Wilder said.

The senior executive admitted the top court’s ruling, coupled with a lack of regulatory progress on ride-sharing in Hong Kong, had “profound consequences” for Uber and the 14,000 active drivers who hoped to find flexible earning opportunities during the coronavirus pandemic.

“We know that the single most common reason for becoming a driver-partner is to make up for lost income during the current economic crisis, with the second most important reason being the need to meet ongoing obligations to support their families,” Wilder said.

Stocks rose on Wednesday, continuing a strong start to September for the market as traders took profits out of high-flying names like Apple and Tesla and snapped up shares in more beaten-down parts of the market. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 300 points, or 1%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1% while the Nasdaq Composite was higher by 0.5%. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs, with the Nasdaq topping 12,000 for the first time. 

Coca-Cola rose more than 3% along with IBM to lead the Dow higher. However, both of those stocks are still down year to date. Apple and Tesla slid 2.6% and 6.5%, respectively, giving back some of their recently sharp gains. The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) rose 1.1% to outperform its Growth counterpart.

Wall Street was coming off a banner session in which the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs. The S&amp;P 500 also logged in its best first trading day of September since 2010, according to Bespoke Investment Group. 

Morgan Stanley Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Mike Wilson said Tuesday on “[Closing Bell](https://www.cnbc.com/closing-bell/)” that he was still optimistic about the market long-term but that weakness in the weeks ahead was on the table after such a strong rally.

 Today, I present Desktop Metal as potentially the best IPO of 2020. This is a 3-D printing company with proprietary methods for printing metals. They have impressive improvements in sintering, heating/extruding, and throughput, and they appear to be the best in the business. I became interested in this company after following one of their key scientists, and learning about the amazing work he has accomplished. I’ve begun diving further into the science behind the company. I’m interested if others have also looked at the science, or what this forum thinks of their financials.

Is that really something to boast about? Not to throw shade on their profitable trading and investment strategies but why does anyone take risk?

Let’s say you want to grow your wealth. How would you do that?

A. Invest in your education / network and get a high-paying job.

B. Take a risk on your existing wealth to get a 10% return (profit) or a 5% loss (assuming a conservative risk-reward ratio of 1:2)

Option B is often touted as ‘passive income’ whereas Option A is touted as ‘Active income’ aka ‘hard-earned money’. Which one is the better option? Would you conserve your ‘hard-earned money’ or would you risk it to earn a little more pocket money?

**Goldman (Neutral rating, $295 price target) comments on today's announcement of $5bn equity raise:**

""We believe key points to help contextualize this news includes:

1) $5 bn of equity issuance would represent about 1% incremental shares based on the 8/31/2020 close.

2) The prospectus states that the use of proceeds would be to further strengthen the balance sheet, and for general corporate purposes.

3) Tesla has a history of issuing equity, but unlike this proposed offering Tesla has typically announced offerings on the day it filed or within a few weeks of filing its 10-Q/10-K. Further, while the company commented on its 4Q19 EPS call that it was not capital constrained, investing as fast as it sensibly could and generating positive cash flow, Tesla has also raised capital post making those comments (the company last issued new equity in February 2020). Finally, the company has capacity expansion plans underway at several factories, and per its last 10-K Tesla expects average annual capex to be $2.5-$3.5 bn from 2020-2022.

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to know if AAPL is overvalued/overpriced or not? I know the first 5G iPhone is coming out and it will have an impact but still, are people putting too much blind trust/faith in AAPL?&lt;/p&gt;

Sales growth of high-value items, across numerous categories, outpaced that of low-value:

-**High-value jewelry sales grew 22x more than low-value**

-**High-value handbag sales grew 2.4x more than low-value**

-**High-value watch sales grew 6x more than low-value**

For the second year in a row, Gucci and Louis Vuitton remain the most in-demand brands within luxury resale. Louis Vuitton edged its way over Gucci for the No. 1 spot for the first time, while Gucci remains the No. 1 Men’s brand for the third year in a row. Driven by a surge in demand for millennials and Gen Z, both brands continued to strengthen their lead over No. 3 brand Chanel.

“In a bright spot during these difficult times, brands, shoppers and consignors alike are engaging in the circular economy,” said Rati Levesque, COO and head of merchandising for The RealReal. “Gen Z, millennials and men are the new faces of luxury shopping, and the brands in tune with what they want are rising to the top.”

Other trends that rose to the top during COVID-19*:

**Stealth luxury favored over logomania:**

-Demand for understated handbags was nearly 5x stronger than that of statement handbags

-Sales for quieter men’s styles grew 2.4x more than statement styles

**Buyers embrace luxury labels’ streetwear designs:**

-Balenciaga becomes No. 1 brand in streetwear

**Buyers and sellers turn to Home/Art like never before:**

-Art consignment was up 150%

-Customers spent 26 percent more on home items compared to apparel, quarter-over-quarter

,investing,"**Factset: How You can Invest in Hedge Funds’ Biggest Investment**

**Tl;dr FactSet is the most undervalued widespread SaaS/IT solution stock that exists**

If any of you have relevant experience or are friends with people in Investment Banking/other high finance, you know that Factset is the lifeblood of their financial analysis toolkit if and when it’s not Bloomberg, which isn’t even publicly traded. Factset has been around since *1978* and it’s considered a staple like Bloomberg in many wealth management firms, and it offers some of the easiest to access and understandable financial data so many newer firms focused less on trading are switching to Factset because it has a lot of the same data Bloomberg offers for half the cost. When it comes to modern financial data, Factset outcompetes Reuters and arguably Bloomberg as well due to their API services which makes Factset much more preferable for quantitative divisions of banks/hedge funds as API integration with Python/R is the most important factor for vast data lakes of financial data, this suggests Factset will be much more prepared for programming making its way into traditional finance fields. According to Factset, their mission for data delivery is to: “Integrate the data you need with your applications, web portals, and statistical packages. Whether you need [market](https://www.factset.com/products-data/market-data), [company](https://www.factset.com/products-data/core-company-data), or [alternative data](https://www.factset.com/products-data/alternative-data), FactSet flexible data delivery services give you normalized data through APIs and a direct delivery of local copies of standard data feeds. Our unique symbology links and aggregates a variety of content sources to ensure consistency, transparency, and data integrity across your business. Build financial models and power customized applications with FactSet APIs in our [developer portal](https://developer.factset.com/)”. Their technical focus for their data delivery system alone should make it stand out compared to Bloomberg, whose UI is far more outdated and complex on top of not being as technically developed as Factset’s. Factset is the key provider of buy-side portfolio analysis for IBs, Hedge funds, and Private Equity firms, and it’s making its way into non-quantitative hedge funds as well because quantitative portfolio management makes automation of risk management and the application of portfolio theory so much easier, and to top it off, Factset’s scenario analysis and simulation is unique in its class. Factset also is able to automate trades based on individual manager risk tolerance and ML optimization for Forex trading as well. Not only does Factset provide solutions for financial companies, they are branching out to all corporations now and providing quantitative analytics for them in the areas of “corporate development, M&amp;A, strategy, treasury, financial planning and analysis, and investor relations workflows”. Factset will eventually in my opinion reach out to Insurance Risk Management a lot more in the future as that’s a huge industry which has yet to see much automation of risk management yet, and with the field wide open, Factset will be the first to take advantage without a shadow of a doubt. So let’s dig into the company’s financials now:

Their latest 8k filing reported the following:

Revenue increased 2.6%, or $9.6 million, to $374.1 million compared with $364.5 million for the same period in fiscal 2019. The increase is primarily due to higher sales of analytics, content and technology solutions (CTS) and wealth management solutions.

Annual Subscription Value (ASV) plus professional services was $1.52 billion at May 31, 2020, compared with $1.45 billion at May 31, 2019. The organic growth rate, which excludes the effects of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency movements, was 5.0%. The primary contributors to this growth rate were higher sales in FactSet's wealth and research workflow solutions and a price increase in the Company's international region

Adjusted operating margin improved to 35.5% compared with 34.0% in the prior year period primarily as a result of reduced employee-related operating expenses due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 11.0% to $2.63 compared with $2.37 for the same period in fiscal 2019.

Adjusted diluted EPS rose 9.2% to $2.86 compared with $2.62 in the prior year period primarily driven by an improvement in operating results.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter decreased to 15.0% compared with 18.6% a year ago, primarily due to an income tax expense in the prior year related to finalizing the Company's tax returns with no similar event for the three months ended May 31, 2020.

FactSet increased its quarterly dividend by $0.05 per share or 7% to $0.77 marking the fifteenth consecutive year the Company has increased dividends, highlighting its continued commitment to returning value to shareholders.

As you can see, there’s not much of a negative sign in sight here.

It makes sense considering how FactSet’s FCF has never slowed down

FactSet’s annual subscriptions and professional services have made its way to foreign and developing markets, and many of them are opting for FactSet’s cheaper services to reduce costs and still get copious amounts of data and models to work with.

Here’s what FactSet had to say regarding its competitive position within the market of providing financial data in its last 10k: “Despite competing products and services, we enjoy high barriers to entry and believe it would be difficult for another vendor to quickly replicate the extensive databases we currently offer. Through our in-depth analytics and client service, we believe we can offer clients a more comprehensive solution with one of the broadest sets of functionalities, through a desktop or mobile user interface or through a standardized or bespoke data feed.” And FactSet is confident that their ML services cannot be replaced by anybody else in the industry either: “In addition, our applications, including our client support and service offerings, are entrenched in the workflow of many financial professionals given the downloading functions and portfolio analysis/screening capabilities offered. We are entrusted with significant amounts of our clients' own proprietary data, including portfolio holdings. As a result, our products have become central to our clients’ investment analysis and decision-making.” ([https://last10k.com/sec-filings/fds#link\_fullReport](https://last10k.com/sec-filings/fds#link_fullReport)), if you read the full report and compare it to the most recent 8K, you’ll find that the real expenses this quarter were far lower than expected by the last 10k as there was a lower than expected tax rate and a 3% increase in expected operating margin from the expected figure as well. The company also reports a 90% customer retention rate over 15 years, so you know that they’re not lying when they say the clients need them for all sorts of financial data whether it’s for M&amp;A or wealth management and Equity analysis:

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/factset.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/factset.asp)

&amp;#x200B;

FactSet also has remarkably good cash conversion considering it’s a subscription based company, a company structure which usually takes on too much leverage. Speaking of leverage, FDS had taken on a lot of leverage in 2015:

&amp;#x200B;

So what’s that about? Why were FactSet’s long term debts at 0 and all of a sudden why’d the spike up? Well usually for a company that’s non-cyclical and has a well-established product (like FactSet) leverage can actually be good at amplifying returns, so FDS used this to their advantage and this was able to help the share’s price during 2015. Also, as you can see debt/ebitda is beginning a rapid decline anyway. This only adds to my theory that FactSet is trying to expand into new playing fields. FactSet obviously didn’t need the leverage to cover their normal costs, because they have always had consistently growing margins and revenue so the debt financing was only for the sake of financing *growth*. And this debt can be considered covered and paid off, considering the net income growth of *32%* between 2018 and 2019 alone and the EPS growth of *33%*

&amp;#x200B;

EBITDA has virtually been exponential for FactSet for a while because of the bang-for-buck for their well-known product, but now as FactSet ventures into algorithmic trading and corporate development the scope for growth is broadly expanded.

&amp;#x200B;

P/E has declined in the past 2 years, making it a great time to buy.

&amp;#x200B;

Increasing ROE despite lowering of leverage post 2016

&amp;#x200B;

Mountains of cash have been piling up in the coffers increasing chances of increased dividends for shareholders (imo dividend is too low right now, but increasing it will tempt more investors into it), and on top of that in the last 10k a large buyback expansion program was implemented for $210m worth of shares, which shows how confident they are in the company itself.

&amp;#x200B;

SGA expense/Gross profit has been declining despite expansion of offices

I’m a bit concerned about the skin in the game leadership has in this company, since very few executives/board members have significant holdings in the company, but the CEO himself is a FactSet veteran, and knows his way around the company. On top of that, Bloomberg remains king for trading and the fixed income security market, and Reuters beats out FactSet here as well. If FactSet really wants to increase cash flow sources, the expansion into insurance and corp dev has to be successful.

Summary: FactSet has a lot of growth still left in its industry which is already fast-growing in and of itself, and it only has more potential at its current valuation. Earnings September 24th should be a massive beat due to investment banking demand and growth plus Hedge fund requirements for data and portfolio management hasn’t gone anywhere and has likely increased due to more market opportunities to buy-in.",t2_4h8ltwha,False,,0,False,Factset DD,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ikndfr,False,dark,0.67,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1599006111.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factset: How You can Invest in Hedge Funds’ Biggest Investment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FactSet increased its quarterly dividend by $0.05 per share or 7% to $0.77 marking the fifteenth consecutive year the Company has increased dividends, highlighting its continued commitment to returning value to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there’s not much of a negative sign in sight here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes sense considering how FactSet’s FCF has never slowed down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FactSet’s annual subscriptions and professional services have made its way to foreign and developing markets, and many of them are opting for FactSet’s cheaper services to reduce costs and still get copious amounts of data and models to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what FactSet had to say regarding its competitive position within the market of providing financial data in its last 10k: “Despite competing products and services, we enjoy high barriers to entry and believe it would be difficult for another vendor to quickly replicate the extensive databases we currently offer. Through our in-depth analytics and client service, we believe we can offer clients a more comprehensive solution with one of the broadest sets of functionalities, through a desktop or mobile user interface or through a standardized or bespoke data feed.” And FactSet is confident that their ML services cannot be replaced by anybody else in the industry either: “In addition, our applications, including our client support and service offerings, are entrenched in the workflow of many financial professionals given the downloading functions and portfolio analysis/screening capabilities offered. We are entrusted with significant amounts of our clients&amp;#39; own proprietary data, including portfolio holdings. As a result, our products have become central to our clients’ investment analysis and decision-making.” (&lt;a href=""https://last10k.com/sec-filings/fds#link_fullReport""&gt;https://last10k.com/sec-filings/fds#link_fullReport&lt;/a&gt;), if you read the full report and compare it to the most recent 8K, you’ll find that the real expenses this quarter were far lower than expected by the last 10k as there was a lower than expected tax rate and a 3% increase in expected operating margin from the expected figure as well. The company also reports a 90% customer retention rate over 15 years, so you know that they’re not lying when they say the clients need them for all sorts of financial data whether it’s for M&amp;amp;A or wealth management and Equity analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/factset.asp""&gt;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/factset.asp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FactSet also has remarkably good cash conversion considering it’s a subscription based company, a company structure which usually takes on too much leverage. Speaking of leverage, FDS had taken on a lot of leverage in 2015:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s that about? Why were FactSet’s long term debts at 0 and all of a sudden why’d the spike up? Well usually for a company that’s non-cyclical and has a well-established product (like FactSet) leverage can actually be good at amplifying returns, so FDS used this to their advantage and this was able to help the share’s price during 2015. Also, as you can see debt/ebitda is beginning a rapid decline anyway. This only adds to my theory that FactSet is trying to expand into new playing fields. FactSet obviously didn’t need the leverage to cover their normal costs, because they have always had consistently growing margins and revenue so the debt financing was only for the sake of financing &lt;em&gt;growth&lt;/em&gt;. And this debt can be considered covered and paid off, considering the net income growth of &lt;em&gt;32%&lt;/em&gt; between 2018 and 2019 alone and the EPS growth of &lt;em&gt;33%&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EBITDA has virtually been exponential for FactSet for a while because of the bang-for-buck for their well-known product, but now as FactSet ventures into algorithmic trading and corporate development the scope for growth is broadly expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P/E has declined in the past 2 years, making it a great time to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing ROE despite lowering of leverage post 2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mountains of cash have been piling up in the coffers increasing chances of increased dividends for shareholders (imo dividend is too low right now, but increasing it will tempt more investors into it), and on top of that in the last 10k a large buyback expansion program was implemented for $210m worth of shares, which shows how confident they are in the company itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SGA expense/Gross profit has been declining despite expansion of offices&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a bit concerned about the skin in the game leadership has in this company, since very few executives/board members have significant holdings in the company, but the CEO himself is a FactSet veteran, and knows his way around the company. On top of that, Bloomberg remains king for trading and the fixed income security market, and Reuters beats out FactSet here as well. If FactSet really wants to increase cash flow sources, the expansion into insurance and corp dev has to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary: FactSet has a lot of growth still left in its industry which is already fast-growing in and of itself, and it only has more potential at its current valuation. Earnings September 24th should be a massive beat due to investment banking demand and growth plus Hedge fund requirements for data and portfolio management hasn’t gone anywhere and has likely increased due to more market opportunities to buy-in.&lt;/p&gt;

It's clear that in markets that trend sideways with lots of volatility the end result is a net negative for levered ETFs.  It's usually argued that overtime this decay will gradually erode the value of the investment. However, back testing a levered version of the S&amp;P500 seems to show otherwise (assuming a 1% expense ratio):

By doing so they were able to reduce volatility and improve return.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s clear that in markets that trend sideways with lots of volatility the end result is a net negative for levered ETFs.  It&amp;#39;s usually argued that overtime this decay will gradually erode the value of the investment. However, back testing a levered version of the S&amp;amp;P500 seems to show otherwise (assuming a 1% expense ratio): &lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Securities fraud class action brought on behalf of all investors who purchased or otherwise acquired VXRT securities during the Class Period – between June 25, 2020 and July 20, 2020, inclusive. The case seeks to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).

Vaxart is a clinical-stage Company purportedly engaged in the discovery and development of vaccines for a variety of diseases that would be administered orally, rather than by injection.

The class action arises from Defendants’ alleged fraudulent scheme to profit from artificially inflating the Company’s stock price by announcing false and misleading information concerning Vaxart’s oral COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

Specifically, the Complaint alleges that on June 26, 2020, Vaxart issued a press release entitled, “Vaxart’s COVID-19 Vaccine Selected for the U.S. Government’s Operation Warp Speed,” falsely claiming its vaccine had been selected to participate in a non-human challenge study, organized and funded by OWS.  This announcement sent the price of Vaxart shares rocketing higher.

In furtherance of the scheme, Defendants amended controlling shareholder Armistice’s existing warrant agreements, allowing Armistice to exercise all of its warrants immediately and sell 27.6 million Vaxart shares, reaping profits of approximately $200 million.  Defendants also issued millions of dollars in favorable stock options to Vaxart’s most senior executives.

The Complaint alleges that on July 25, 2020, details emerged revealing Defendants’ deception concerning their alleged pump and dump scheme. In particular, on July 25, 2020, The New York Times published an article entitled, “Corporate Insiders Pocket $1 Billion in Rush for Coronavirus Vaccine,” covering suspiciously timed stock bets that had generated significant profits for senior executives and board members at companies developing vaccines and treatments. Vaxart was featured prominently in the article, and it clarified “Vaxart is not among the companies selected to receive significant financial support from Warp Speed.” In response to this news, the price of Vaxart shares dropped sharply lower on July 27, 2020 from $12.29 to $11.16.

“We’re focused on investors’ losses and proving Vaxart misled investors about OWS’s potential funding support for the Company,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.",t2_673fhjew,False,,0,False,VXRT Class Action Law Suit,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ikk7sq,False,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598995600.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Securities fraud class action brought on behalf of all investors who purchased or otherwise acquired VXRT securities during the Class Period – between June 25, 2020 and July 20, 2020, inclusive.

,investing,"Seeing the recent rapid rise of the market and some stock went skyrocketed, I am curious about what would the academia think on the phenomenon, So I looked for research papers that were published on journals and would like to share this particular paper on 'bubble' with you all.

The paper [bubble for fama](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v131y2019i1p20-43.html) is written by Greenwood, Robin, Shleifer, Andrei and You, Yang and was published in the Journal of Financial Economics, one of the most eminent financial journal. They aimed to evaluate the saying from Eugene Fama, 2013 Nobel laureate in economic sciences. Who once said in 2016 ""For bubbles, I want a systematic way of identifying them. It’s a simple proposition. You have to be able to predict that there is some end to it. All the tests people have done trying to do that don’t work. Statistically, people have not come up with ways of identifying bubbles.""  Here are what the authors of the paper have done.

First of all, they put their focus on industries instead of individual stocks. A major reason for this is bubbles, by nature is very hard to define, using industry as a unit ensure the same phenomenon is experienced by the same enough firms. (Imagine a penny stock that can go up by 100% then drop in an hour, is it very hard to define if it is a bubble for statistical analysis). Researchers defined an industry is experiencing a 'price runs up' if the return for the past 2 years is over 100%, and define a bubble burst to be over 40% drops in the following 2 years after the peak. 

Using data from 1928 to 2014. Researchers have identified 40 'runs up' in the US stock market. And they realise the Eugene Fama is mostly right in the sense that you couldn't tell if a price run-up will be followed by a burst of not. In the 40 episodes, 21 of them experienced an over 40% crash while the other 19 episodes didn't. So you cannot say something is in a bubble just because their price has gone up by a lot. And the average time needed for the bubble episodes to reach the peaks varies from 0 months to 17 months. So it would be against the stat if you were to short sell a rapid raising industry, not only you would be proven wrong about half the time, you also need to have extreme deep pocket combined with a lot of patients to win the battle. For episodes that indeed crashed, on average they will return to the market level, and generally speaking, the market is always rising given long enough time. The implication here is even if you buy in a bubble industry, you might still retain some gains after the bubble burst (most likely to be beaten by the market tho).

However, there's more to come. The researchers further study who's the differences between the crashing episodes and the non-crashing episodes. They found that there are some characteristics that distinguish crashing and non-crashing, all with p-value &lt; 10% (That is they have 1/10 chances their statistical significance is happened by chance). They are: 

1. 1-year change in volatility (Volatility from year T-1 to now, minus volatility from year T-2 to year T-1). On average the volatility change is positive for crashed episodes and slightly negative for non-crash episodes.
2. firm age. Crashed episodes are on average 15 percentile rank younger than non-crashed episodes.
3. age tilt (to capture whether the price run-up occurred disproportionately among the younger firms in the industry). Crashed episodes' price run-up has a higher concentration in younger firms.
4. Percentage of Issuers ( percentage of firms in the industry which issued new shares within the last two years) Crashed episodes have a higher percentage of issuers.
5. Acceleration (Difference between 2 years return to (year T-2 to year T-1 return) Crashed episodes have a higher acceleration. Around 30% higher in fact.

Then the researchers asked, can these characteristics predict the coming 2 years return for the 40 episodes identified? The answer is yes and no. After going through some statistic measure and control for market return. None of these characteristics can predict future returns with satisfactory statistical power. However, if we don't control for market return, all of the above can predict a lower return within the coming 24 months. And on the [online appendix](http://docplayer.net/136929952-Internet-appendix-with-supplement-results-for-bubbles-for-fama-robin-greenwood-andrei-shleifer-and-yang-you-last-updated-sep.html) , they also show using these characteristics as signal to avoid bubble can boost the return to 10% more compared with the benchmark index.

Although the paper's focus is on the industry level, but I believe the discovery is linked with strong behavioural/economics explanation and is applicable to individual stocks. One thing I forgot to mention above is that almost all the bubbles happened in a bull market. Reading this paper reminds me of today's market. I am still a student and relatively new to the investing world. English isn't my first language so apologies if there are places that isn't clear enough. Thanks for reading.

*The Fed now “seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,” rather than 2% inflation as a fixed goal. What this means in practice is that:*

*“following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.”*

When FED announced unlimited QE in mid-march, I didn't understand the implication of that and was still expecting for further market crash and reduced amount of my monthly investment. So would like to avoid the same mistake and analyze and discuss the implication of this major policy shift better.

,investing,"Serious, I'd like to hear from you what you think is the marker of a market wide correction... or a crash to come.   Personally, I really thought the AAPL TSLA stock split was it.  I expected a correction across most of NASDAQ today.   The valuation run up after the split-announcement and before the actual split (today) was incredible... and IMHO... unwarranted.  I predicted (incorrectly) that profiteers were looking to sell off after the split and there could be a considerable sell off today.  I thought the fact that today was the last day of the month might be a catalyst of a sell off.  Perhaps ETF and Mutual Fund adjustments resulted in pulling AAPL and TSLA up, not down.  
I'm not a bear, or bearish.  I'm holding these because I felt they both have legs for the long run but the recent run up has me nervous and I believe large sectors are oversold (starting with FAANG, including all EVs).  


I'm a private investor.  A day trader (more of a week trader) of sorts.  I'm diversified.  I don't need advice on what to buy, or sell.  I'm more interested in discussing the next large swing of the market.  
Looking forward, unemployment is up but hasn't taken hold of the markets yet.  Unemployment benefits were chopped in half.   15MM+ renters are behind in rent.  Consumer spending is at an all time low.  I know I know the stocks going up don't depend (directly) on consumer spending but where does FAANG stop?  I predicted 10% above Feb 1, 2020 values was the ceiling.  We are well beyond that.  


I'll offer my prediction in exchange for yours.  I have no tacit data to support my thinking but here it is.  FAANG will get a correction somewhere along the line.  Not a crash.  Maybe a 10-15% drop from ATH.  That correction will stop this bull run and with everyone declaring tech as 'oversold' FAANG et all will hang at a stagnant value into perpetuity.   I offer MSFT from 2001 to 2012 as an example.   After the tech-crash of 2001, MSFT was 'stuck' at $35 for over 10 years.   10 years of steady improvements in customer base, product diversity, and increasing revenues but investors couldn't seem to care.  


Retail investors (who all suffer from ADD) will flock to other sectors while waiting for the next tech-bull-run to start.  It will be hard to start if MSFT, AAPL, GOOG can't sustain growth of cloud and retail sales.  But the customers (business and private customers) who buy these products will cool off as they themselves struggle with reduced revenues (see consumer spending).  It's election time and FB and others are enjoying increased ad revenue that will vaporize in Nov.  


But when?  Man... I don't know.  Assuming this run is caused by retail investors, perhaps the harbinger will be the fund managers who declare 'enough' and boldly exit.

I have been lurking here and reviewing other stock investment sites for some time now and I wanted to get some direct opinions on some investment decisions that I am thinking of making.

My issue is that I own $2,000,000 dollars of AAPL and $1,000,000 of TSLA (In real life and the simulator, don’t worry I own plenty other stocks too.) 

TSLA and AAPL stocks just split, and in real life this did not effect me since I was compensated. But in the simulator it shows a loss of $2,000,000. 

Does this happen normally and will it resolve itself with time? Does it just take a while for it to process splits? Or do I have to abandon the simulator? It is useful because while I own the exact same stocks on the simulator and in real life, it is good to test the waters, and it is nice to have open on another monitor to see how my stocks are doing at a glance.

,investing,"On Friday, WSJ reported AT&amp;T is exploring a deal for its DirecTV business, and has been in talks with private-equity players. This follows several other media reports over the last few years (CNBC, WSJ) that AT&amp;T has been considering selling its DirecTV business, as well as comments by DISH management that a combination of Dish's satellite operations with DirecTV are inevitable.

Goldman issued the following report this morning outlining some interesting thoughts:

**Why would AT&amp;T sell DirecTV? Three potential objectives:**

1. **Streamlining AT&amp;T's operations to focus on mobile, broadband and streaming entertainment.** AT&amp;T is the most diversified company in the US communications and media sector. While this diversification has the potential to yield certain competitive advantages, such as AT&amp;T's bundles of wireless and broadband connectivity with its streaming video services such as HBO Max, we believe it has also created a degree of operational complexity. This is especially the case, in our view, for the DirecTV satellite TV service, which is experiencing significant structural headwinds owing to industry-wide cord-cutting that is not only resulting in customer losses, but reducing the appeal of the service in AT&amp;T's product bundles.

With AT&amp;T having already made its flagship HBO Max streaming service available to its DirecTV customers, we believe the company has now captured the majority of the product and cost synergies from this asset. As such AT&amp;T may view that it can be a more focused and nimble competitor in its core mobile, broadband and streaming markets by divesting control of its satellite TV operations in the US. Indeed, separating from AT&amp;T could also allow DirecTV to operate in a structure that works better for a mature cash-generative business, which could benefit AT&amp;T to the extent it retained a stake in the company.

2) **Accelerate AT&amp;T's balance sheet deleveraging.** Since completing the acquisition of Time Warner in 2018, AT&amp;T has reduced it net debt by $25 billion from $177 billion to $152 billion as of 2Q20 through a combination of strong FCF, asset sales and other asset monetizations. While this has lowered its net debt/EBITDA from 3.3x to 2.7x, the company remains well above its historical leverage in the low-2x range, which we believe remains its long-term target. As such, we believe that AT&amp;T could likely consider any transaction that enabled it to accelerate its delevering by pulling forward value for non-core assets. Even if a transaction were only modestly delevering, in terms of its net leverage ratio, we believe that simply lowering the gross dollar amount of outstanding debt could improve AT&amp;T's financial flexibility by making it less reliant on the investment grade credit markets during a period of significant economic uncertainty.

3) **Achieve further cost efficiencies and synergies.** This opportunity would likely only apply to a combination with another pay-TV operator (vs. a financial buyer) owing to significant overlapping costs. We have not attempted to estimate synergies from this type of hypothetical combination, but AT&amp;T's own combination of DirecTV with its U-verse business in 2015 could be a potential precedent.

That merger represented the combination of DirecTV's base of 20 million US satellite TV subscribers with AT&amp;T's base of 6 million landline U-verse video subscribers. While these services were based on different infrastructure, the company initially estimated cost synergies would exceed $1.6 billion on an annual run rate basis by year-three after closing. One year later, AT&amp;T increased this target to $2.5 billion, based on lower programming costs across the combined video operations (DirecTV + U-verse) with other savings from core operational functions (e.g., truck rolls, billing, customer care, advertising, etc.).

**A combination with Dish could face regulatory scrutiny.**

For details on the potential regulatory considerations facing a potential merger of DirecTV and Dish, please see takeaways from our discussion with Andrew Lipman, partner at law firm Morgan Lewis, at the 28th Annual Communacopia conference in 2019. Here is our summary of Mr. Lipman's comments, which you can find in the report cited above:

Mr. Lipman believes that Dish and DirecTV could potentially get a deal through federal regulatory authorities if there was a will from both companies to merge. This is despite the failure of a similar proposal to merge between the two satellite operators in 2002. He believes that the pay-TV market has changed drastically since the original merger attempt (i.e. fiber and cable presence in rural areas, OTT offerings). Mr. Lipman believes that such a deal could potentially be structured in different ways to address the government's likely concerns that rural areas could be hurt by this merger including 1) price freezes or 2) allowing the two companies to combine back office functions, prior to a potential full merger.

**What impact would a sale of DirecTV have on the pay-TV market?**

We do not believe that a partial sale of DirecTV to financial partners, or any entity which would continue to operate DirecTV as an independent satellite TV operator, would have a material impact on the pay-TV market. This is because such a hypothetical transaction would not significantly impact the number of competitors. To some extent, it could yield a modest increase in competition as DirecTV would now compete directly with AT&amp;T's other pay-TV services, including its new Internet-based service AT&amp;T TV. However, we do not see this as a material change in the overall competitive backdrop.

A theoretical combination of DirecTV with Dish would represent a merger of the 2nd (DirecTV) and 4th (Dish) largest pay-TV providers in the US, resulting in a new company with over 25 million video customers (as of 2019), ranking it ahead of the current #1 Comcast (21.2 million). As such, a merger of the US's two satellite TV operators could lower competition among traditional facilities-based pay-TV providers. However, as we detailed in our recent initiation report on the US media sector, traditional pay-TV services are already experiencing material subscriber losses owing to competition from new streaming services. The pressures on satellite TV providers have been particularly intense, with the combined customer bases of DirecTV and Dish declining by 13% in 2019 vs. video subscriber declines of approximately 3% for the major cable providers. As such, a theoretical combination of these companies could potentially enable them to generate synergies that position them to remain viable competitors in the pay-TV sector longer than if they remained independent.

**What is DirecTV's financial contribution to AT&amp;T**

AT&amp;T does not report any financial or operating metrics for its DirecTV satellite TV operations. This business is included within the company's Entertainment Group segment, which in 2019 generated $45 billion of revenue (25% of consolidated revenue) and $10 billion in EBITDA (17% of consolidated EBITDA). Below, we provide our rough estimates for the size of the DirecTV subscriber base and its contributions to AT&amp;T's revenue and EBITDA in 2019. These estimates are intended to be illustrative in order to provide context for the scale of DirecTV within AT&amp;T's consolidated operations and relative to peers in the pay-TV sector.

**We estimate that AT&amp;T ended 2019 with approximately 16 million DirecTV satellite TV subscribers**, out of 19.5 million total Premium TV subscribers. As of YE2018, when AT&amp;T last disclosed the mix of it Premium TV subscriber base, the company had 19.2 million DirecTV satellite TV subscribers and 3.7 million U-verse video subscribers. In 2019, the company's combined Premium TV subscriber base declined 15%, which we believe was primarily driven by losses of DirecTV customers owing to the end of promotional pricing. For context, the large cable operators, whose video + broadband service bundles are more comparable to the U-verse offerings, saw their video subscriber bases decline by approximately 3% in 2019. If we assume the same trend played-out with U-verse, then that implies the DirecTV subscriber base declined 17% in 2019.

For context, this implies that DirecTV ended 2019 roughly tied with Charter (16.1 million video subscribers) as the second largest pay-TV service in the US. This compares to Comcast's video subscriber base of 21.2 million and Dish's satellite TV subscriber base of 9.4 million.

**We estimate that DirecTV generated approximately $25 billion of revenue in 2019**. We arrive at this estimate by assuming that ARPU for DirecTV subscribers is comparable to AT&amp;T's reported Premium TV ARPU in 2019 of $121. This implies that in 2019 the DirecTV satellite TV service contributed 57% of Entertainment Group revenue (14% of consolidated).

**We estimate that DirecTV generated approximately $7 billion of EBITDA in 2019**. This estimate implies an EBITDA margin in the mid/high 20%s. We believe this is a reasonable rough estimate based on few factors. First, DirecTV's closest peer, Dish, operates with an EBITDA margin of approximately 20%. Based on AT&amp;T's scale in video vs. Dish, we estimate that its average monthly programming costs per Premium TV subscriber is approximately $5 lower than DISH's. This estimated cost advantage represents approximately 4-percentage points of margin benefit for DirecTV vs. this peer.

Second, we assume additional scale benefits in SG&amp;A. For context, when AT&amp;T acquired DirecTV in 2015, its US satellite TV operations generated an EBITDA margin of approximately 25%. While we estimate that the DirecTV subscriber base in the US has declined by over 20% since the acquisition, we also estimate that AT&amp;T has increased the service's ARPU by over 10% and generated cost synergies, which management previously estimated would reach a run-rate of $2.5 billion. We therefore believe it is reasonable to estimate that margins have remained at least flat, and likely improved, since the acquisition of DirecTV, despite material subscriber losses.

Our approximate estimate for DirecTV's EBITDA implies that in 2019 it contributed nearly 70% of Entertainment Group EBITDA (12% of consolidated).",t2_4eerimgi,False,,0,False,$T - thoughts on the potential sale of DirecTV,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ik5l65,False,dark,0.76,,public,16,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,16,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598933533.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, WSJ reported AT&amp;amp;T is exploring a deal for its DirecTV business, and has been in talks with private-equity players.

,investing,"I come to r/investing hoping this post can somewhat explain what’s happening in Tesla, since every day there’s a lot of questions about it. I understand my post isn’t is not the typical r/investing post, but my post is meant to hopefully explain some things the r/investing crowd may not have heavy exposure to, which is options and how they are having a massive effect on certain stocks, particularly Tesla. 

So to begin with, I see way too many posts like P/E of stock XYZ is too high. Tesla is one of these XYZ stocks, but the market has changed. No one really cares about P/E anymore. All that matters is supply and demand and especially through options. Unfortunately, because of retail, the entire options market has changed the last few months, which probably changed the behavior of funds too, causing the entire market to change. Here’s a quick explanation using some options terminology of what I see is happening. 

Call volume is almost like 90% today and it’s historically skewed towards calls, especially calls that put pressure on the upside skew of the vol curve (which brings in kurtosis). That’s the only thing that matters. If people buy calls -&gt; the stock will keep going up because it’s natural float is so low and big players like Musk and Baron don’t sell to cause any selling pressure. 

The equity game has changed to the point most people are now making their bullish bets through options to gain max leverage. If there are a lot of people buying calls, that’s a bullish sentiment and so the stock will go up, just like when people buy a lot of shares. People have to get that in their heads that supply/demand is what drives price moves and options provide a leveraged version of supply and demand. 

The calls on Tesla cause the name to explode even more to the upside than a boring name like say an INTC because Tesla comes with the extra special convexity/kurtosis bonus in that if the stock goes up, volatility explodes and gamma explodes. Hence market makers now will have to be desperate to buy as many shares as possible to stay delta neutral to the new skew, causing a feedback loop to bring the stock even higher.

This is also easier to do the lower the stock price, since calls become more affordable to retail. Whether that was Elon’s motivation for splitting the stock or not is unknown, but he’s a smart guy. I’m sure he probably knows.

It could theoretically work in reverse too, going down through the same short strikes it went through, but you would need a major catalyst. A major QQQ selloff or some announcement that’s bad for Elon Musk could trigger a -20% selloff since it does work in reverse, but in a natural market environment, this should not happen.

Simple STRATEGY: The strategy IMO is to buy SHARES. Buying puts is probably a no-no but you could get lucky once in a while with timing. Shorting shares is definitely a no-no unless you want to go bankrupt. Buying calls could be really good if you time it right, but the main issue with buying the calls is you have to buy it at the right vol level. Market makers are not just going to let you run them over, so they will naturally jack up this skew/call IV to a high level where they can win even selling calls and having the stock go up. For example, if Tesla is 490 now and a market maker sold a 600 call and delta hedged it by buying shares, they will win if the stock goes up to 600 even at expiration. The 600 call buyer would actually lose unless he sold earlier. Thus, shares is probably the better play. Nevertheless, the reason for these explosive up moves  is explained by options.

If you are uncomfortable with buying shares due to the high P/E and bubble like nature of Tesla, I can understand that. However, you must also understand investing should be more than a financial statement now. You must factor in things like options volume in terms of investing. Using the same mindset, this is why I would never ever invest in a stock like XOM. No retail is going in and buying XOM calls. This can be said about CSCO too. You don’t get that options pressure you want, which is a “fundamental” reason for a stock to go up. So if you don’t like Tesla since it is indeed a high P/E, you can apply this same idea and buy Apple (or Microsoft) then. It’s a lower and reasonable P/E, has similar call option volume flow, and is a much better long term investment than XOM or CSCO.",t2_7q5wojx4,False,,0,False,Tesla call volume will cause the stock to keep going up - as explained using some options terminology,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ik3r8r,False,dark,0.79,,public,56,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,56,,False,,1598899494.0,,[],{},,True,,1598927854.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I come to &lt;a href=""/r/investing""&gt;r/investing&lt;/a&gt; hoping this post can somewhat explain what’s happening in Tesla, since every day there’s a lot of questions about it.

 On going political and social issues around the globe, and the underlying fear behind Covid-19 still  stifling economies are just some of the problems investors are having to deal with. When it comes to making conscience decisions during these cloudy periods, its important to remain true to your strategy. Whether its value, dividend, bonds, ETF's, or prospective investing, having a game plan has never been more important. Looking at balance sheets and valuating companies on growth potential has never been more important. And cash, cash per share has an amplified influence on a companies value in these waters. 

**ABBV**; The 170 billion dollar Drug manufacturer is set to make over $12 a share this year and is recording 17% earnings growth this year, 18% next, sales up 26% last quarter, and pays a 5% dividend. It is selling at $95 a share currently. This should be at the top of everyone's radar. Even if the stock doesn't move much in the near term, sales and earnings are growing, and that's what's important here.   


**ATVI**; Activision Blizzard has cemented themselves as one of the staple gaming companies in the industry.

&lt;p&gt;On going political and social issues around the globe, and the underlying fear behind Covid-19 still  stifling economies are just some of the problems investors are having to deal with. When it comes to making conscience decisions during these cloudy periods, its important to remain true to your strategy. Whether its value, dividend, bonds, ETF&amp;#39;s, or prospective investing, having a game plan has never been more important. Looking at balance sheets and valuating companies on growth potential has never been more important. And cash, cash per share has an amplified influence on a companies value in these waters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABBV&lt;/strong&gt;; The 170 billion dollar Drug manufacturer is set to make over $12 a share this year and is recording 17% earnings growth this year, 18% next, sales up 26% last quarter, and pays a 5% dividend. It is selling at $95 a share currently. This should be at the top of everyone&amp;#39;s radar. Even if the stock doesn&amp;#39;t move much in the near term, sales and earnings are growing, and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s important here.   &lt;/p&gt;

Amazon has a model that it employs to not take out but rather to take control of certain markets.  Most are aware that they have done this with books and diapers, selling them at a loss for millions of dollars to take the reign.

Once Amazon selects a target, there is not much life left in that target.  And next on their target list is Chewy.  This choice also allows a variance in the market place takedown as they tend to oscillate between markets to avoid scrutiny.  Books, Diapers, and Pet Food have nothing in common except that they are HUGE markets, all nearing the 60-100 billion range.

Anywho I’ve picked up lots of chatter/intel that they are positioning themselves to take out Chewy, a pet food delivery service that was recently just sold by its founder Ryan Cohen.  Apparently Ryan was privy to this and did the smart thing and cashed out.  My understanding is that a back channel was created to tease the idea of selling to Amazon and that Amazon prefered to do it the not nice way.  Moreover, apparently there has been an uptick in “front companies” inquiring/researching buying out large pet food makers.

This choice also allows a variance in the market place takedown as they tend to oscillate between markets to avoid scrutiny.  Books, Diapers, and Pet Food have nothing in common except that they are HUGE markets, all nearing the 60-100 billion range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anywho I’ve picked up lots of chatter/intel that they are positioning themselves to take out Chewy, a pet food delivery service that was recently just sold by its founder Ryan Cohen.  Apparently Ryan was privy to this and did the smart thing and cashed out.  My understanding is that a back channel was created to tease the idea of selling to Amazon and that Amazon prefered to do it the not nice way.  Moreover, apparently there has been an uptick in “front companies” inquiring/researching buying out large pet food makers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dont take my word for it, do your own research and try to convince yourself differently.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have Chewy stock, I’d sell soon.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"So after the bullish week NIO had last week, they decided to make an offering of 75mm shares. Since the price tanked, they decided to make a second offering to rise the goal of 1.5 billions... Just months after they secured funding from the chinese goverment for that same amount of dollars.

Many seem to believe the offering is well placed due to the run and because they wanted to increase their ownership from around 70 to 80 something percent.

From a shareholders perspective, this seems to be a very dodgy move. I believe this is more about greed than anything else by the company's management. 70-80% ownership does not have any meaningful value since they already have the majority of the company's ownership.

In any case, we will see how the market reacts (already down 5% in pre market). And as a typical case of dodgy moves by the chinese, I consider this a risky bet at this price range. I am setting a stop-loss at 16.5 level and might reenter the stock at a latter date.

Aside from the SEC filing, Linus provides some perspective as someone who is very well-versed with Corsair

Pros
Dominant position in the industry
Brand loyalty and established business


Cons
Have been making losses before 2020
Limited room for growth beyond the position they are in
If COVID-19 drags on, they will continue to do well, and even after the pandemic some people may end up buying equipment for home use in the LR.
Questionable acquisition of OriginPC
Does not own any factories

Conclusion:
Luke says short due to volatility and hype in the short term, long in the long term.

Linus would ""not buy the stock at all"", due to his belief of the company's potential, and he thinks that he average investor wouldn't buy the hype around rgb peripherals.

,investing,"Hello guys and gals,

So i have been a longtime lurker on this sub-reddit since I started my investing journey in early 2018. I wanted to get input on how one would go about pricing a stock that is not traded on any financial market. Rather, the stock is purchased from directly from known buyers. The thing is that you would have to first figure out who owns the stock through an ad or simply asking around.

The company first sold its shares at 10$ a piece in 2004. Fast forward 16 years later, and the same share is supposedly valued at $10. This year the stock paid 1.42 in its annual dividends to shareholders. By this amount, if you had purchased the stock at $10, you would have a 14.2% dividend yield. What I am baffled about is that the company does not know how to value its own stock and often tells its shareholders that the book value of the share is about $28 (2019 financials). People still buy and sell the stock somewhere from 10 - 15$ each. I quickly saw the opportunity and amassed quite an amount of stock from people who had shares and could not value them properly other than from the price they paid (which was at $10 each).

My question is how would you value the stock given the stock performance over the years? Below are some metrics I compiled. Please note that I am not a finance person so I did some calculations pulled from the bank financials since 2009. 

(USD)

**2009:**

Earnings Per Share: 1.28

Dividends: $0.68

**2019:**

Assets: 171.5 mil

Stockholder Equity: 26 mil

Net Income: 2.66 mil

Earnings Per Share: $2.85

Dividends: $1.43

Book Value: $27.87

Dividend Payout Ratio: 53.6%

&amp;#x200B;

Average Dividend Growth Rate: 7.64%

Average Book Value Growth Rate: 4.28%

Average EPS Growth Rate: 8.28%

Average ROE: 8.51%

Tickers: VOO, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, ARKW, ARKG, T, KO  (These are my current holdings in my Roth and I firmly believe in all of them for the long run. Tech is everywhere and not going anywhere anytime soon imo).

If I set all my position to a **min. of 5% each, after around 6 years, I get around $40,000** after an initial investment of $10,000. If I set a **minimum % of 0.01 for each of my positions, so that each position would show up, after around 6 years, I get around $51,000** after an initial investment of $10,000.

When looking at the allocation % for each position for the ""No minimum % weight"", I can see that QQQ and VOO have less than 0.05%. **The highest weight was in MSFT at 43% while ARKW is 2nd at 38%**, then AAPL at 14%. I found this odd since I believed that investing more towards index funds, or ETFs that track NASDAQ or the S&amp;P500, would've been better in the long run.

So, I removed ARKW and ARKG due to their recent inception year of 2014. Then, **I swapped VOO with SPY** since VOO had an inception year of 2010 and they both track the same thing. Now, **I have a 21 year period I can look at**, since QQQ's inception year was 1999.

Trying both methods again, 5% min. weight and 0.01% min. weight, I got around $640,000 and $1,200,000 respectively. **Both are very heavily weighted towards AAPL**, which makes sense since if I bought AAPL shares in 1999, each share would've costed around $1.30 and would've grown to over $15,000 each if AAPL never had stock splits.

But again, if I look at the other position weight %s, **QQQ and SPY had less than 0.6% combined** (and in the 5% portfolio, both are at the minimum of 5%).

**SO, is it wrong for me to think that I should NOT invest more in VOO and QQQ (or similar positions), like I am now and instead, more towards solid companies or ETF's (like ARKW) with a long horizon like Apple and Microsoft or other solid companies after I do my DD on each of them?**

&lt;p&gt;Trying both methods again, 5% min. weight and 0.01% min. weight, I got around $640,000 and $1,200,000 respectively. &lt;strong&gt;Both are very heavily weighted towards AAPL&lt;/strong&gt;, which makes sense since if I bought AAPL shares in 1999, each share would&amp;#39;ve costed around $1.30 and would&amp;#39;ve grown to over $15,000 each if AAPL never had stock splits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But again, if I look at the other position weight %s, &lt;strong&gt;QQQ and SPY had less than 0.6% combined&lt;/strong&gt; (and in the 5% portfolio, both are at the minimum of 5%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SO, is it wrong for me to think that I should NOT invest more in VOO and QQQ (or similar positions), like I am now and instead, more towards solid companies or ETF&amp;#39;s (like ARKW) with a long horizon like Apple and Microsoft or other solid companies after I do my DD on each of them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 1: While I understand that past returns don&amp;#39;t hold true for the future, in my view, it does create a decent base to start off with.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"&gt;(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway ([BRKa.N](https://uk.reuters.com/companies/BRKa.N)) said on Sunday it has acquired more than 5% stakes in each of the five leading Japanese trading companies.  
&gt;  
&gt;Berkshire Hathaway’s wholly-owned subsidiary, National Indemnity Company, will notify Japan’s Kanto Local Finance Bureau of the purchase of the stakes in Itochu Corp ([8001.T](https://uk.reuters.com/companies/8001.T)), Marubeni Corp ([8002.T](https://uk.reuters.com/companies/8002.T)), Mitsubishi Corp ([8058.T](https://uk.reuters.com/companies/8058.T)), Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd ([8031.T](https://uk.reuters.com/companies/8031.T)) and Sumitomo Corp ([8053.T](https://uk.reuters.com/companies/8053.T)), the company said in a statement.  
&gt;  
&gt;Berkshire Hathaway intends to hold its Japanese investments for the long term, but may increase its holdings up to a maximum of 9.9% in any of the five investments depending on price, the company said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The five major trading companies have many joint ventures throughout the world and are likely to have more of these partnerships. I hope that in the future there may be opportunities of mutual benefit,” Buffett said.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (&lt;a href=""https://uk.reuters.com/companies/BRKa.N""&gt;BRKa.N&lt;/a&gt;) said on Sunday it has acquired more than 5% stakes in each of the five leading Japanese trading companies.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Hathaway’s wholly-owned subsidiary, National Indemnity Company, will notify Japan’s Kanto Local Finance Bureau of the purchase of the stakes in Itochu Corp (&lt;a href=""https://uk.reuters.com/companies/8001.T""&gt;8001.T&lt;/a&gt;), Marubeni Corp (&lt;a href=""https://uk.reuters.com/companies/8002.T""&gt;8002.T&lt;/a&gt;), Mitsubishi Corp (&lt;a href=""https://uk.reuters.com/companies/8058.T""&gt;8058.T&lt;/a&gt;), Mitsui &amp;amp; Co Ltd (&lt;a href=""https://uk.reuters.com/companies/8031.T""&gt;8031.T&lt;/a&gt;) and Sumitomo Corp (&lt;a href=""https://uk.reuters.com/companies/8053.T""&gt;8053.T&lt;/a&gt;), the company said in a statement.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Hathaway intends to hold its Japanese investments for the long term, but may increase its holdings up to a maximum of 9.9% in any of the five investments depending on price, the company said.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The five major trading companies have many joint ventures throughout the world and are likely to have more of these partnerships. I hope that in the future there may be opportunities of mutual benefit,” Buffett said.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"  

Today we’re going to talk about float, what it is and how you can build billion-dollar companies with it. Float is the money that a business receives today but doesn’t have to pay out until sometime in the future. Float is most commonly seen in insurance companies with customers paying premiums upfront to insure themselves against bad things happening sometime in the future. More examples include: Video game publishers, where they receive pre-orders. Commercial banking when they receive deposits and so on. 

Why is receiving money upfront so valuable even when it needs to be paid at later date? Well, you can invest it! And the longer you have to invest it, the more likely it will grow larger than the amount that you will have to eventually pay out! So, you can see how easily this can snowball. Say I owned a tiny insurance business that insured $1,000 worth of damages for a year in exchange for a $100 upfront payment. If I have $10,000 in the bank I can safely have say, five customers insured like this every year for $500. Every year I can invest the money I got from those new customers and every year the cash I have grows so I can safely insure more customers and the cash you have grows in an exponential manner. Ok cool got it. So, what does this have to do with Berkshire Hathaway?

Sometime around the mid-1960s Mr. Buffett realized, with the help of his friend Charlie Munger, that he can’t keep investing in broken down businesses and had to instead look for “franchise” business that will continue to compound his hard earned capital through thick and thin. The next thing he realized is that he couldn’t just rely on the free cash flow generated from those company’s and had to instead find low cost financing for his acquisitions. That low cost financing came in the form of an insurance float which, as we’ve seen, are the premiums paid by insurance customers up front in order to be paid out by the insurance company later. Buffett bought a ton of these insurance companies starting with National Indemnity in 1967

Wait, why did we just say that float is low cost financing? Why is it financing and what is the cost of that financing? Well, float is financing because you are receiving money today, but you have to pay it out sometime in the future, exactly like a loan. The beauty of float though is that you don’t have to pay interest on that money! The only “interest” that you have to pay on that money is the normal cost of operating your business.

We’ve already seen why float would matter so much to Buffett, but it bears repeating.  A dollar you receive today is worth more than a dollar you get a week from now because you can invest it at some rate to receive more money in the future. Buffet realized that the more float he had, the more float he could invest to buy other businesses. Float would compound in lockstep with the free-cashflow generated by his other businesses and in time create a juggernaut.

The final step in the Berkshire secret formula was increasing the duration of time between when the premiums are received and when they’re paid out. So, for Buffett, this meant buying up longer tailed insurance companies like insurance for catastrophes, and recently, Reinsurance companies.  And there you have it!

I'm not going to say I know for sure what is optimal, but what I can do is provide some actual numbers.

I calculated rolling total return for various holding periods across the entire range.  I then compared them to each other to see how often the stocks had a negative return, and how often they were outperformed by the various bond classes.

I expect these numbers may be quite surprising to some people, especially since the past decade has been a generous bull market that makes equities look invincible.  Anyway, if anybody has other quantitative means of looking at this, please share.  Happy investing!

Sitting atop a cash pile of over $100 billion dollars, Warren Buffet is often asked why Berkshire Hathaway does not pay a dividend. The standard answer for the past thirty or forty years has been that Berkshire’s cash pile would be better spent on either acquisitions or share buybacks. While there is certainly truth to this statement, there is a bigger reason for the lack of a Berkshire yield.

Warren Buffett personally owns approximately 250,000 shares of Class A Berkshire stock. Often Buffett has been quoted as saying he has “never sold a share of Berkshire Hathaway.” If this is true, that would indicate that in the process of building up his multi-billion-dollar fortune, Buffett has never paid any income taxes on his Berkshire shares. Assuming Buffett does not, or has not, ever personally sold any Berkshire shares, that would mean he is not only a savvy investor but also the undisputed master of the unrealized gain. 

Warren has often said he draws a yearly salary of $100,000 from Berkshire Hathaway. Assuming his Berkshire salary is accurate and he has little else for additional income coming in, it is likely that Buffett (a multi-billionaire) pays nearly the same amount of income taxes as you or I. A Berkshire dividend would be exceptionally detrimental to Buffett’s income tax bill. A quick calculation to demonstrate:

(all numbers very approximate for demonstration purposes)

Number of “A” shares owned by Buffett: 250,000

A 5% yield on Berkshire “A” shares for 1 year would yield (for Buffett) approximately: $4,087,500,000

A 20% capital gain tax on his dividend would result in a personal tax bill of approximately: $817,500,000

With Berkshire paying a 5% yield, not only would Buffett end up with a near $1 billion tax bill, he would also have to find a place to invest nearly $3 billion of his after-tax dividend income (every year). This clearly demonstrates why he prefers share buybacks over dividend payouts.

Buffett is a multi-billionaire and he certainly did not get there by accident. As a result of (arguably) the greatest (legal) tax avoidance scheme in the history of modern American business, Buffett has painted himself into a corner when it comes to the payment of a Berkshire dividend. Berkshire investors can pretty near be guaranteed Berkshire Hathaway will never pay a divided as long as Buffett is alive and holding his shares.

What I don’t understand is, why? Is it all to avoid the capital gains tax?

Say I already have 10K profit after holding for 2 years, then a bearish market appears. The 10K becomes 9, and you can see the 8 and 7 coming.

Why not just sell, wait for it to get down, and just re-buy down there? If it comes back up faster than you expected, just re-buy at where you left off (9K) and there’s no fuss.

I also hear “keep some cash handy so you can buy once it does go down”. Why isn’t that cash just the outcome of selling some of your current positions?

If it is to avoid capital gains tax, what’s the advise if you end-up living in a tax-free country?

Could this person disregard the “ride the wave” advise, and in reality for this scenario it would be wiser to: sell high buy low as you please?

&lt;p&gt;Say I already have 10K profit after holding for 2 years, then a bearish market appears. The 10K becomes 9, and you can see the 8 and 7 coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not just sell, wait for it to get down, and just re-buy down there? If it comes back up faster than you expected, just re-buy at where you left off (9K) and there’s no fuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also hear “keep some cash handy so you can buy once it does go down”. Why isn’t that cash just the outcome of selling some of your current positions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is to avoid capital gains tax, what’s the advise if you end-up living in a tax-free country?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could this person disregard the “ride the wave” advise, and in reality for this scenario it would be wiser to: sell high buy low as you please?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—————&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m asking because I’ve just been following every advise in books and blogs, but never really questioned that this would be an advise for an American with taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"So I know that bonds decrease in value when interest rates rise (because you could get higher returns on newly issued bonds). But isn't this ""decrease in bond value"" only relative to the second market? I.e, this ""decreased bond value"" is only important in the context of other investors wanting to buy/sell bonds to one another?

So if you have a bond with 2% interest rate yield, but the interest rates are now 3%, obviously you aren't getting the maximum possible return, but as your interest rate returns are still the same, regardless of how the second market values your lower interest bond, you're still getting a profit-- albeit it just being less than the maximum possible, correct?

So my question is, is the decreasing value of your bond in the secondary market when interest rates increase only significant if you're looking to make the most profit/buy the most profitable type of bond available?

Simplifying the picture, is it safe to assume one is ""greedy"" (simplifying desires for greater profit margins) for worrying about increased interest rates and thus the (declining) value of the associated bond, as in the end you still get back your bond equity + original 2% interest rate?

Also, if the interest rate is increasing, for the long term, doesn't that mean inflation will (at the very least) slow down?

First of all im bored since a few months so i startet my intrest in the stock and cryptocurrency market.

Btw im not a native english speaker nor a writer so excuse me if i did some mistakes in my text, i still hope u can read it and get what im tryna tell you 😉

So as some of you may have heard of XRP (Ripple) for the ones who havent, XRP is a low priced cryptocurrency that offers financial institutions the fastest, most reliable option for
sourcing liquidity on demand.
XRP sells at the moment of typing at around 0.27$ per XRP Coin.

For the past few months i recognized something around the price: the price starts mostly round 0.24/0.25$ sometimes even lower and goes up to its limit (wich lays round 0.29-0.30$) at round 15.- 22. of the month and then drops pretty quick and takes another month till its up again.
in my financial situation atm i cant go all in but now i know +/- when it goes up and when its good to buy  so i always wait a month and get paid out (at my investment as i said i usually buy myself round 100XRP and sell them when the price gets up like 4-5cents which means i make a total profit of round 4-5 bucks) as i mentioned before if u have alot of money this is definitely worth it as it repeats itself nearly every month at literally the same time spawn and its good extra money haha

to say it like if i explain it to my lil siter if u invest round 240$ in XRP it gets you at some point if the price is low enough round 1000XRP that means if the Price of the XRP goes up by only 1 cent you make 10$! if you buy urself 10000XRP u get arround 100$ per cent it goes up!

Example: 
Buy $100

Balance $100
Capital Gains -.15% -30% (-$15/-$30)
Profit $85/$70)

To my understanding, You only pay the capital gains tax on the profits (/losses) amount? Do you pay per share or the total gained? Also it&amp;#39;s 15% and 30% depending on the length of the stock
Example: 
Buy $100
Sale . $200

Capital Gains -.15% -30% (-$15/-$30)
Profit $85/$70) &lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Economies of scale is the single most important competitive advantage that a company can possess in its market. Economies of scale is achieved when a company can progressively lower its costs as more and more products are produced. Said another way, the more customers you have for a product or service, the more you can spread fixed costs to each customer which lowers the total cost of each product. It follows then that the types of business that most benefit from economies of scale are those that have very high fixed costs as opposed to high variable costs.

So why are economies of scale the most durable competitive advantage available? Imagine you own the only grocery store in town, for years it is profitable, and everyone seems to enjoy going to it. One day a new grocery store opens across the street and begins taking market share. Should you, the owner, panic and sell the store immediately? No of course not. Assuming the new grocery store is not much more efficient and does not have much better selection or technology, your store will always win because you can spread your fixed costs across your large customer base while your competitor cannot. So, if there is a price war you will always win and even before that you will always have lower prices than your competitor.

Ok, what does this have to do with Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway? Amazon’s entire business has been and always will be about scale. I present to you the world’s most famous napkin:

&amp;#x200B;

This is Amazon’s business model in nutshell, drawn in the late 90s by Bezos himself. Note that the inside of this reinforcing loop can be applied to almost any retailer that has ever existed. Amazon’s real special sauce though, is the way that it lowers cost structure by investing in scale and then uses that scale to lower its prices.  Investing in scale means building fulfillment centers, hiring software engineers and doing whatever it takes to own the entire value chain. Crucially, this investment in scale means that it is harder for competitors to replicate Amazon’s value proposition because, as we’ve seen before, investing in high fixed costs businesses mean that you must have enough customers to be able to spread those costs until it reaches a reasonable per unit level. Since Amazon’s second main organization focus is customer service, they are hoping it would be very hard for competitors to get enough eCommerce customers to get those fixed costs down to a competitive level. So, this is the principle behind everything that Amazon does. AWS? Scale. Prime Video? Scale. And so on. You might be wondering, if Amazon keeps entering these extremely high fixed cost businesses, how do they get enough customers to make it work? The answer is Amazon Prime. Amazon is the new grocery store that also gives you everything else in the town for free. So now if you are the owner of the old grocery store in town, you're not just competing with the new store, you're competing with everything else the town has to offer bundled into one. That's how they get around the scale problem and that's how they can keep on entering tough, scale intensive, industries and succeed.",t2_7whqrqof,False,,0,False,Amazon and the Supremacy of Scale,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ij3lia,False,dark,0.53,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,1598748245.0,,[],{},,True,,1598776647.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economies of scale is the single most important competitive advantage that a company can possess in its market.

We both are public educators contribute to public retirement scheme. I, additionally, have a Roth and a Traditional IRA with monies allocated largely to VFIAX and VIGAX.

**Suggestion** \- I would like my spouse to release $10k of our savings to invest in a variety of Vanguard Bond ETFs.

,investing,"Hey people, I see a lot of talk on investment websites about buying  stocks, bonds, gold, crypto, foreign currency, art, collectables, real  estate... etc

This is all fine, but this type of investment has some downsides, at least for me personally:

\-  it's pretty much passive... you just buy stocks, or whatever and wait,  you do nothing with it, you just expect passive income from it

\-  you have no control over what you bought (with the exception of real-estate perhaps), even if you own a few stocks of, say, Coca-Cola  you have no say regarding its management etc... even if you own gold  bars... you can do nothing with them except sell them at appropriate  time

\- I am not really sure if these are even real investments at all, as they hardly create new value, at least  not directly... when you buy stock it just changes owner, nothing  physical happens in the world as a result of your investment (I know it might indirectly benefit the company whose stocks you buy, but it's  still not that you're directly creating any value)

\-  The return is quite predictable-  the higher the  risk, the higher potential return, but there are very few possibilities  to earn a lot, with low risk. Return of investment is generally low, unless there's a lot of risk involved.

**So  there's another type of investment that fascinates me much more, but I  see very little talk about it on the Internet: investing in machinery,  means of production, capital goods, etc...**

I am wondering  why it is so rarely mentioned on websites about investment. What branch  of economics deal with these types of investments? Where to study it?

I think this type of investment is much more interesting for the following reasons:

\-  when you buy a machine or build a factory and put it to use, you're  directly contributing to the economic growth, you're directly creating  new value

\- there is **way more potential**  to profit because **the value of factories, capital goods, etc... is not  the same for everyone and it's not necessarily related to their price**.  Whoever buys a stock can expect exactly the same return from that stock.  But if a doctor who is the owner of a private clinic buys a gastroscope  and knows how to perform gastroscopy or has employees who know,  he can expect huge return of the  investment from such a purchase while that same piece of equipment would  be pretty much worthless to me, as I am not a doctor and I don't own a clinic.

Or another example: for a  multinational brewing company, the value of a regional brewery is much  higher than for some other random company or individual, because that  company has its brand name, know how, developed marketing network, and  upon acquiring a regional brewery it can make much higher profit from  it, than some other company without the experience in brewing  business would ever be able to make.

\- with these  investments you have much more control over what you bought and the  return of investment does not depend only on the value of the equipment  bought, but also on your skill to put it to use...

I am wondering why these types of investments are neglected? If investment was all about buying stocks and other financial assets, the economy would collapse... all the companies would be like Berkshire Hathaway... But luckily, we see a lot of companies making meaningful purchases by buying other companies they know how to manage (like when Google bought YouTube) and then further investing into capital goods in them, etc...

But if a doctor who is the owner of a private clinic buys a gastroscope  and knows how to perform gastroscopy or has employees who know,  he can expect huge return of the  investment from such a purchase while that same piece of equipment would  be pretty much worthless to me, as I am not a doctor and I don&amp;#39;t own a clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or another example: for a  multinational brewing company, the value of a regional brewery is much  higher than for some other random company or individual, because that  company has its brand name, know how, developed marketing network, and  upon acquiring a regional brewery it can make much higher profit from  it, than some other company without the experience in brewing  business would ever be able to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- with these  investments you have much more control over what you bought and the  return of investment does not depend only on the value of the equipment  bought, but also on your skill to put it to use...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am wondering why these types of investments are neglected? If investment was all about buying stocks and other financial assets, the economy would collapse... all the companies would be like Berkshire Hathaway... But luckily, we see a lot of companies making meaningful purchases by buying other companies they know how to manage (like when Google bought YouTube) and then further investing into capital goods in them, etc... Of course in this way both the companies grow, but also the economy grows as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;	NEW YORK (Reuters) - Herbalife Nutrition Ltd will pay $123.1 million to settle criminal and civil charges it bribed Chinese officials in government agencies and media outlets to boost its business in China, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Friday.

&gt;The multi-level marketing company, whose products include dietary supplements, entered a three-year deferred prosecution agreement in which it admitted to conspiring to violate the books and records provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, an anti-bribery law.

&gt;Authorities said Herbalife schemed from 2007 to 2016 to bribe Chinese officials with cash, entertainment, meals and travel to obtain direct selling licenses, reduce government scrutiny and suppress negative coverage by state-controlled media.

&gt;China accounted for 19% of Herbalife’s $4.49 billion of net sales in 2016, up from 7% in 2006, regulatory filings show.

,investing,"[IB's introduction about CFD](https://ibkr.info/article/1912)

If I have done my DD seriously and am convinced that it would go up long term, imo CFD is better than LEAP because of no theta decay. InteractiveBroker is not market maker as a CFD trading platform. It just makes money by charging commission and margin rate(&lt;2%) so we don't have to worry that we are fighting against brokers. What's more, because it can leverage 5x at most, I wouldn't be wiped out even if the stock drop 20% (assume the leverage is 2.5x) or 30% (assume the leverage is 2x). While the margin loan only accept 2x leverage at most, investors are usually forced to sell even if they actually don't mind to keep hold or you can only leverage like 1.2\~1.5x.

&lt;p&gt;If I have done my DD seriously and am convinced that it would go up long term, imo CFD is better than LEAP because of no theta decay. InteractiveBroker is not market maker as a CFD trading platform. It just makes money by charging commission and margin rate(&amp;lt;2%) so we don&amp;#39;t have to worry that we are fighting against brokers. What&amp;#39;s more, because it can leverage 5x at most, I wouldn&amp;#39;t be wiped out even if the stock drop 20% (assume the leverage is 2.5x) or 30% (assume the leverage is 2x). While the margin loan only accept 2x leverage at most, investors are usually forced to sell even if they actually don&amp;#39;t mind to keep hold or you can only leverage like 1.2~1.5x. There is also CFD for SPY,VOO, which is better than ES future because there is no expiry date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I think CFD is much better tool if leverage is below 2.5x.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Let's get this straight: the price of a stock is not random\*. The price is (theoretically) all future earnings of a company discounted at some rate (depending on the risk of the stock) to the present day. What this means is that in order for you to rationally price a stock, you first want to see what money it will deliver to you in the future, and how likely it is to deliver that money. The more earnings and/or the more likely it is to achieve those earnings, the higher the price. So, to price a stock, you form your expectations about all future earnings and discount them depending on the risk of the stock to today's money, and now you can rationally decide if a stock is a buy or sell or even short. This whole thing is called the Discounted Cash Flow Model.

Now, this is the essence of this post: a change in expectations about future earnings, or a change in the discount rate are the only things that change investor sentiment about a stock. It is not how it has historically performed nor about its current situation. It is always how do investors feel about the future of the company.

A lot of people on this sub like that point out the history of a stock to jusifity going long, or the fact that the company is projected to make a lot of money or that it currently does. The reality is that all of that is reflected in the price of the stock. You can use historical earnings to project future earnings, but that is all, and those future earnings are already reflected in the stock's price. Only a change in expectations or the risk of a company meeting expectations influence the price of the stock. This ultimately means only future events can change the price of the stock, and unless you can predict the future, for all intents and purposes, the price of a stock today is right.

Here's a consequence of this line of thinking:

You want to know why Apple is $2.1T in market cap? It is a mix of high earnings in the future and a very low risk of missing.

Have low risk necessarily means having lower future returns. Almost all (&gt;97%) returns are explained by taking on more risk (using the Fama-French 5 factor model). This is the fundamental idea behind investing, and is basically a law at this point. High risk = high reward.

Apple being priced high means that it's expectations are high (meaning for anyone who invests in Apple right now, they are expecting Apple to earn lots of money) and those expectations are not terribly risky. This ultimately means that for Apple investors to make returns at or above the market, Apple has to consistently beat expectations and become even a safer investment in order for current investors to make returns.

What this ultimately means is that in the long-term, large cap growth stocks are not the best investments you should have. Companies like Apple are basically guaranteeing you low returns in the long run. If you have a long time horizon, you should be investing in systematically risky assets because in the long run, you make more returns. Things like value, and small cap stocks are higher risk and higher reward.

\*Price movements are a random walk, but that is because the future is effectively random.",t2_if2zf,False,,0,False,A reminder on what moves the price of a stock,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_iii8hb,False,dark,0.66,,public,24,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,24,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598686995.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s get this straight: the price of a stock is not random*. The price is (theoretically) all future earnings of a company discounted at some rate (depending on the risk of the stock) to the present day. What this means is that in order for you to rationally price a stock, you first want to see what money it will deliver to you in the future, and how likely it is to deliver that money. The more earnings and/or the more likely it is to achieve those earnings, the higher the price. So, to price a stock, you form your expectations about all future earnings and discount them depending on the risk of the stock to today&amp;#39;s money, and now you can rationally decide if a stock is a buy or sell or even short. This whole thing is called the Discounted Cash Flow Model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this is the essence of this post: a change in expectations about future earnings, or a change in the discount rate are the only things that change investor sentiment about a stock. It is not how it has historically performed nor about its current situation. It is always how do investors feel about the future of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people on this sub like that point out the history of a stock to jusifity going long, or the fact that the company is projected to make a lot of money or that it currently does. The reality is that all of that is reflected in the price of the stock. You can use historical earnings to project future earnings, but that is all, and those future earnings are already reflected in the stock&amp;#39;s price. Only a change in expectations or the risk of a company meeting expectations influence the price of the stock. This ultimately means only future events can change the price of the stock, and unless you can predict the future, for all intents and purposes, the price of a stock today is right.&lt;/p&gt;

When it comes to building a portfolio of SWAN (sleep well at night) stocks for the long term, HSY is a layup. In the world of stock investing, HSY is an ideal stock for beginners and seasoned investors alike because of its relatively simple business model and its ability to generate consistent returns. The business itself is very straightforward. HSY owns some very recognizable brands such as Reese's and KitKat (HSY owns the rights to KitKat in the US). On average they manage to sell more candy than the year before and with it also raise prices at a rate higher than inflation. As the bulk of their profits are earned in the US, their income statements (reported in USD) are an accurate reflection of what they actually earned. Compare that to other excellent companies like CL, KO etc which are a little harder to evaluate as they earn most of their profits overseas and you have to factor in currency fluctuations to get the real picture (their annual reports usually do a good job of it though).  As Peter Lynch said, ""Invest in what you know"" and it's safe to say most Americans have consumed a Hershey's product at some point in their lives. Heck, you can even use the excuse of ""market research""  to buy some Reese's peanut butter cups the next time you go to the store.

[Morningstar does a great job putting together the financials.](https://financials.morningstar.com/ratios/r.html?t=0P000002NZ&amp;culture=en&amp;platform=sal) Check with your local library to see if you can get access to Morningstar or Value Line. It's very useful to anyone looking to research individual stocks. While paying for a subscription yourself can cost several hundreds of dollars annually, most public libraries in the US give you access to one or both of those services for free. I'll try to sum up the key metrics shared in the link above (anyone can view that page even without a subscription)

Over the last 10 years

Net sales growth of \~4% (What's even more impressive is that most of it was achieved with volume increases and pricing power alone. Acquisitions had little to do with it)

EPS growth 8-10%

Div yield 2-3% (The payout ratio stays around 50% which means you also see dividend growth that's 8-10%)

They buy back roughly 1% of outstanding shares each year.

Just like that you get 11-13% CAGR (excluding PE compression/expansion). ROIC consistently in the high teens to 20+ (consumer staples usually average in the mid teens)

Operating margin has increased from 17.4% to 21% (PEP for example was around 15% last year)

To check the quality of the balance sheet, we look at the interest coverage ratio and Net Debt w.r.t Operating Profits. With capital light businesses like HSY, their ability to grow profits/free cash flow is a better indicator of financial strength than shareholder equity.

Interest coverage ratio (Interest expense/EBIT) \~ 10 (A double digit value for a consumer staples company is considered very safe)

Net Debt/EBIT \~ 2.5 (Anything less than 3 for a consumer staples company is considered very safe)

&amp;#x200B;

**Stock Performance**

HSY has historically fluctuated between a PE of 30 (overpriced) to a PE of 20 (a bargain). Every once in a blue moon the PE dips below 20 and the div yield approaches 3% at which point it becomes a screaming bargain. Barring a total economic collapse or horrendous mismanagement, it's very unlikely you'll see HSY trading at a PE of 15. I would say a PE of 23-25 is a fair price for a wonderful company.

As with any investment, the price you pay affects future returns. To get the real picture of returns generated by HSY, one needs to look at a full business cycle as consumer staples generally tend to outperform during a recession.

[The absolute worst time to buy HSY in the last 15 years](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;startYear=2005&amp;firstMonth=4&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=HSY&amp;allocation1_1=100) would have been in early 2005 when the PE was over 30 and the dividend yield was below 1.5%. A $10,000 investment with dividends reinvested in April 2005 would result in a present value of $34,863 with a CAGR of 8.49% (underperformed the SPY which returned $37,404 at 8.98%).

Realistically speaking, for an investor who DCAs into this stock, their returns would've been somewhere between 8.5% - 13.8%. HSY is not a stock that you can expect 20%+ CAGR from, but with some luck compounding at 11-12% can build significant wealth (and potentially even outperform SPY).

**Risks**

As far as stocks go, HSY has to be one of the safest investments out there. The company is very conservatively run as the Hershey Trust owns roughly 40% of the company (but over 80% voting rights) and uses the dividends to fund a school for underprivileged children. The dividend is sacrosanct and HSY management is less likely to jeopardize the dividend in search of growth. Consumer staples as a business also face less disruption than other industries. Profits are consistent and the business requires fairly little reinvestment. Candy, alcohol and tobacco are centuries old and consumer tastes change fairly slowly which gives companies plenty of time to adapt. MSFT would go out of business if they were still selling the same OS they made in the 90s. HSY on the other hand is more or less still selling the same candy it was 30-40 years ago. That being said, past performance is no guarantee of future results. So let's address some realistic risks

\- Ruining the quality of the product due to cost cuts in search of short term profits. [Irene Rosenfeld at Mondelez did this to the Cadbury Creme Egg](https://theconservativeincomeinvestor.com/why-mondelez-stock-hasnt-gone-up/), which didn't bode well for the stock. A big part of the reason why I'm willing to pay a premium for a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup (over some generic brand candy) is because of the taste.  HSY would lose their hard earned market share and goodwill in search of short term gains.

\- Compromising the balance sheet for a bad acquisition. KHC is a good example of this. The 3G method involves slashing costs and levering up the balance sheet to acquire more businesses. Of course, if the acquisition doesn't pan out the stock gets punished accordingly. HSY has tried to build their international presence through acquisitions and it hasn't panned out well so far. Lately they've started diversifying into savory snacks. However, these tend to be pretty small in nature.

\- A sugar tax to combat obesity. I don't think it'll hurt the underlying business too much, but HSY might start trading at a lower earnings multiple.

\- E-commerce might affect HSY a bit. Outside of a few holidays the bulk of candy sales come from impulse purchases a consumer makes at the checkout counter at the store. It usually isn't something a person puts on their shopping list. I think with some proactive management, HSY can get around that by working with vendors to advertise their products while checking out online (much like how pizza joints upsell soda/breadsticks etc at checkout time).

**Conclusion**

If you've made it this far, I thank you for reading this post. I mostly wrote this for people who might be looking into buying individual stocks. I think HSY is an excellent stock for those looking for an above average dividend yield and dividend growth. Buffet often speaks fondly of his See's Candies investment. Much like his own investment, with some luck HSY's dividends alone can pay you back your initial investment and then some over an investing lifetime. As always, sticking with a low cost index fund is a sound strategy. Even a stock like HSY requires a few hours of work each year.

&lt;p&gt;- A sugar tax to combat obesity. I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;ll hurt the underlying business too much, but HSY might start trading at a lower earnings multiple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- E-commerce might affect HSY a bit. Outside of a few holidays the bulk of candy sales come from impulse purchases a consumer makes at the checkout counter at the store. It usually isn&amp;#39;t something a person puts on their shopping list. I think with some proactive management, HSY can get around that by working with vendors to advertise their products while checking out online (much like how pizza joints upsell soda/breadsticks etc at checkout time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve made it this far, I thank you for reading this post. I mostly wrote this for people who might be looking into buying individual stocks. I think HSY is an excellent stock for those looking for an above average dividend yield and dividend growth. Buffet often speaks fondly of his See&amp;#39;s Candies investment. Much like his own investment, with some luck HSY&amp;#39;s dividends alone can pay you back your initial investment and then some over an investing lifetime. As always, sticking with a low cost index fund is a sound strategy. Even a stock like HSY requires a few hours of work each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt; HSY good. VTSAX good.&lt;/p&gt;

I feel pretty confident in Pfizer, Ratheon, and Exxon as stocks. They distribute great dividends, have a strong and rich history, and aren't going anywhere.

,investing,"For those who subscribe to having the majority or the entirety of their equity holdings to consist of ETF/funds from the S&amp;P 500, the impact to their portfolio as a function of any one company has increased substantially.

Even with total market funds like Vanguard's VTI, these five stocks make up an outsized portion of the fund because of market cap weight.  

Much like investors using ""ex-US"" funds to increase exposure to international holdings, are there funds that are ""ex-FAANG"" so individuals can lessen the impact?  If not, would another practical strategy be to buy more non-tech sector funds as opposed to say buy more of the 400+ other S&amp;P 500 stocks as counterweight.

Thoughts?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT1:**  /u/exaggerate_a_point summed up my ask better than my own attempt so I'll add it here instead of responding to similar comments:

&gt; OP specifically said he/she wants to de-risk, aka diversify. It's not about not holding good companies, it's about hedging the risk if one has a bad series of news or events. It's inherently risky if your portfolio is heavily weighted in a handful of companies.

Another good summary of the ask for this discussion from /u/FerociousGiraffe :

&gt;Trying to move your portfolio away from FAANG isn’t to say those are great, successful, hugely profitable companies. You’d keep a position in them. It’s about protecting against news that will only hurt FAANG while not hurting the broader market.

**EDIT2:**  For comments related to balancing with international equities, this discussion is contained for U.S. equities.  Assume whatever percentage of bonds, precious metals, digital currency, international equities or whatever you think is appropriate in a portfolio has been addressed.

**EDIT3:**  Outside of suggestions like ""Why do you hate winning?"", some of the top solutions to dilute these stocks from your S&amp;P 500 / U.S. equities part of a portfolio:

* Many suggest a variation of my original post of simply adding more sector funds outside of tech.  Though this strategy will unfortunately remove many non-giant tech companies in this sector.

* Many of you like /u/desquibnt suggests equal weighted ETFs like RSP.  However, RSP has a high net expense ratio of 0.20%.  

* /u/TriathlonNerd suggests a reverse cap weighted ETF like RVRS.  This too has a high net expense ratio of 0.29%.

&lt;p&gt;Even with total market funds like Vanguard&amp;#39;s VTI, these five stocks make up an outsized portion of the fund because of market cap weight.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like investors using &amp;quot;ex-US&amp;quot; funds to increase exposure to international holdings, are there funds that are &amp;quot;ex-FAANG&amp;quot; so individuals can lessen the impact?  If not, would another practical strategy be to buy more non-tech sector funds as opposed to say buy more of the 400+ other S&amp;amp;P 500 stocks as counterweight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT1:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a href=""/u/exaggerate_a_point""&gt;/u/exaggerate_a_point&lt;/a&gt; summed up my ask better than my own attempt so I&amp;#39;ll add it here instead of responding to similar comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OP specifically said he/she wants to de-risk, aka diversify. It&amp;#39;s not about not holding good companies, it&amp;#39;s about hedging the risk if one has a bad series of news or events. It&amp;#39;s inherently risky if your portfolio is heavily weighted in a handful of companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good summary of the ask for this discussion from &lt;a href=""/u/FerociousGiraffe""&gt;/u/FerociousGiraffe&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to move your portfolio away from FAANG isn’t to say those are great, successful, hugely profitable companies. You’d keep a position in them. It’s about protecting against news that will only hurt FAANG while not hurting the broader market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT2:&lt;/strong&gt;  For comments related to balancing with international equities, this discussion is contained for U.S. equities.  Assume whatever percentage of bonds, precious metals, digital currency, international equities or whatever you think is appropriate in a portfolio has been addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT3:&lt;/strong&gt;  Outside of suggestions like &amp;quot;Why do you hate winning?&amp;quot;, some of the top solutions to dilute these stocks from your S&amp;amp;P 500 / U.S. equities part of a portfolio:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many suggest a variation of my original post of simply adding more sector funds outside of tech.  Though this strategy will unfortunately remove many non-giant tech companies in this sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of you like &lt;a href=""/u/desquibnt""&gt;/u/desquibnt&lt;/a&gt; suggests equal weighted ETFs like RSP.  However, RSP has a high net expense ratio of 0.20%.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/TriathlonNerd""&gt;/u/TriathlonNerd&lt;/a&gt; suggests a reverse cap weighted ETF like RVRS.  This too has a high net expense ratio of 0.29%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/BubbyginkESO""&gt;/u/BubbyginkESO&lt;/a&gt; and others suggests going broader than just 500 companies with low cost total market funds like Vanguard&amp;#39;s VTI or Fidelity&amp;#39;s FZROX.

1. Azure: Recall, in 4Q20, Azure growth decelerated to 47% yoy (50% cc) compared to 59% growth in 3Q20 (61% cc). Investors continue to focus on the pace of deceleration within Azure, the impact of COVID-19 on cloud migrations and consumption, and changes in the revenue mix between consumption (IaaS and PaaS) and the per user SaaS revenue (EMS). Management noted several puts and takes to the impact of COVID-19 on Azure growth, noting some impact in consumption in heavily impacted industries and a focus on optimization, noting however that the overall trend has been customers redoubling their commitment to migrating to the public cloud. Management added, that as the pace of growth in EMS moderates, with enterprise mobility seats growing 26% yoy in 4Q20 versus 34% in F3Q20, there will be a corresponding impact to overall Azure growth as the revenue mix continues to shift more towards IaaS and PaaS.
2. Commercial Cloud Gross Margins: Management noted continuous improvement in IaaS and PaaS gross margins, as the company continues to expand capacity within its existing datacenter footprint, increase power efficiency, and optimize the company’s existing software stack to run more efficiently. However, management noted the pace of margin expansion within Azure will be partially offset as revenue mixes more towards lower gross margin consumption revenue (and away from SaaS). Recall, in 4Q20 Commercial Cloud gross margins reached 66% (+1pt yoy) compared to 67% in F3Q20 (+4pts yoy), highlighting the impact from moderating revenue growth in the Azure per user business.
3. Office 365: Recall in 4Q20 Office 365 commercial seat growth moderated to 15% yoy, compared to 20% in F3Q20. Management attributed some of the slowdown to better than expected adoption of a 6 month E1 free trial the company introduced following COVID19 (which ended in June) along with some weakness within SMB. Management also noted strength in the pipeline with the opportunity to convert free trial customers to paid users as the trials expire. Management noted continued room for APRU growth driven by SKU migration with a large E1 installed base noting traction in E3 and E5 SKUs; strength in E5 has been driven in part by advanced security and compliance offerings. With respect to Teams, management noted a number of enhancements in recent months as the company continues to close the feature functionality gap relative to competitive offerings in both collaboration and videoconferencing software.
4. Windows: Management highlighted that Windows Commercial continues to grow as a percentage of overall Windows revenue (\~30% as of 2Q20) driving the mix of recurring revenue higher within the segment. Windows Pro, Windows Non-Pro, and Other comprise the remaining \~40%, \~20% and 10% respectively. Management noted commercial PC strength following mid-March shelter in place orders began to fade in 4Q; however, this was offset by strength in the consumer market. Going forward, management pointed to expectations for a low-teens decline in the Windows OEM business driven by continued weakness in SMB and a tough compare.
5. Gaming: With more people working from home, gaming continues to show strength, with gaming revenue growing 64% yoy in F4Q20. Heading into an upcoming console cycle management noted that increased demand associated with WFH should result in lower inventory levels relative to prior console cycles. Management also noted balanced strength throughout the company’s gaming portfolio in 4Q20, with strength in first party titles and the company’s subscription business which surpassed 10mn subscribers in April.",t2_4eerimgi,False,,0,False,$MSFT - takeaways from virtual investor meeting at Goldman yesterday,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ihlq10,False,dark,0.88,,public,54,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,54,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598566305.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman hosted a virtual NDR with Michael Spencer, General Manager - Investor Relations at $MSFT* yesterday.

Feel free to skip over this post and leave the obligatory ""stop pumping uranium"" or ""nuclear power is terrible"" comment at the door. For those that aren't, here is another update on my series of posts about the uranium sector, a sector with the most asymmetrical risk/reward opportunity in the current market.

So, why am I brining you yet another update? Partially to present to you a link that will direct you to a whole library of different analysis reports on the uranium industry as a whole and about specific companies in the sector. There are 105 different reports just for 2020 and more for the previous years. Just search for whatever specific thing you are looking for and read away. Here is the link:
https://uraniumequities.com/research-reports/

However, that is definitely not the only reason I am writing you all another update. In the past few years, a lot of analysts in the uranium sector (best example is Rick Rule) have been saying that a restart of Japanese nuclear power plants would signal the start of a new bull market in the sector. As years passed, the uranium bull case has had plenty of other catalysts to get it going (Kazatomprom and Cameco mine closures and further [supply cuts for the coming 2 years](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Kazatomprom-extends-uranium-production-cuts-into-2) on Kazatomprom's part, increased number of new power plants constructed and planned in Asia, no significant new mines coming online, more support for nuclear energy in the US and several more that add up to the bull case I have been describing in my previous posts).

Now, the restart of several Japanese nuclear reactors has joined the growing list of catalysts as reported [here:](https://mobile.twitter.com/SStapczynski/status/1296705957020332034)
 
Although it doesn't seem like much of a change in the grand scheme of things, one has to remember Japan still has significant uranium fuel reserves that will now be used to fuel their nuclear reactors, further decreasing the global uranium supply and bringing new demand back online. Since restarts of power plants typically require a significant amount of 'new fuel' to start their power production with the building of a new core, these restarts will only add to the increasing supply deficit as portrayed [here](https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/supply-demand) by Cameco 

So why is this time different? Why is it that people have been predicting this thing to happen for years and it hasn't changed? I get exactly why the people that ask this are skeptical and rightly so that they are, because people have been saying it since 2016. What is different now however, is the above mentioned report that Japan is restarting faster than anticipated. Which, as mentioned above, was widely seen as the thing that will light a fire under the sector once more

Now, what does this change about a bull case that was already convincing enough as it is in my opinion? It adds yet another catalyst to the list and further charges up the bull case. Many expected Japan to take several more years to start bringing back their nuclear power plants, so this is a very nice boost for the sector and one many analysts did not take into direct account when calculating the ever increasing supply deficit. But even with most reactors still offline in Japan, the amount of electricity generated by nuclear power plants around the world is now [ back to levels not seens since 2006](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Nuclear-generation-in-2019-close-to-record-high).

TLDR:
The restart of Japanese nuclear power plants is a big positive for the uranium sector, just around a time when there were already several catalysts present for an extremely compelling bull case. Demand is only increasing while supply is being cut by the world's biggest producer Kazatomprom. The deficit is growing and the spot price for uranium will soon increase to incentivize new production.

,investing,"This Post intends to give an overview over the ticker RLFTF, it is divided in different sections to give a holistic overview over RLFTF. RLFTF is a Drug Development Company registered at the Swiss Stock Exchange RLF.SW and US OTC Ticker RLFTF.

RLFTF's patented drug RLF-100^(TM)(Aviptadil/VIP) has a FDA Fast Track designation and is in two Clinical Trials and a FDA Intermediate Expanded Access Program. Preliminary data show a mortality reduction of over 90% in the most critical COVID-19 ICU Patients.^(3)

**Clinical Data and Mechanism of Action - why this is the best COVID-19 drug.**

RLF-100(Aviptadil/VIP) has a 30 year research history and is already Approved by some Countries for other Indications (UK Approved for Errectile Dysfunction and EU Orphan drug status for Sarcoidosis treatment \*EU designation (EU/3/07/473)), it is already known to be a safe drug with minimal side-effects. ^(5,6)

*Mechanism Of Action*

1. RLF-100 inhibits the SARS-COV-2(COVID19) Virus from replicating itself by blocking the      respective receptors. **It is the only known Drug** so far that **prevents      the Virus from replicating**(spreading), it act's preventive and not just symptomatic. ^(1)
2. RLF-100 prevents and/or stops the Cytokine Storm, is highly anti-inflamantory and acts on RANTES (CCL5) - in almost the same way that e.g. CYDY's LL drug does.^(2)
3. RLF-100 is a natural peptide produced and used by the body to protect &amp; heal the lung and to      improve blood oxygenation. Severe CASES of COVID-19 have shown low levels of exactly this Peptide.^(3)

*Clinical Data*

Currently there are 2 Clinical Trials underway and a FDA Intermediate Expanded Access Program.

1. Phase 2/3 Trial, IV RLF-100 for Critical COVID-19 Patients, Estimated completion in September 2020 [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04311697](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04311697)
2. FDA granted IND for Clinical Trial of RLF-100 in inhaled version with the goal to provide a **preventive treatment at home** to prevent a moderate/severe COVID-19 infection.^(4) Estimated      completion in November [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04360096](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04360096)
3. FDA Intermediate Population Expanded Access of RLF-100, Expanded Access Program for cases too critical to be part of the above studies. In this EAP aims to treat the most critical COVID-19 Patient. [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04453839](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04453839)

All currently available Clinical Data regarding COVID-19 is from the Expanded Access. The first 21 Patients showed a Rapid recovery and a mortality reduction of over 90%. This patients consist out of the worst case COVID-19 cases like patients with combined double lung transplant rejection and severe COVID-19 infections. ^(3)

*Summary:*

RLF-100 blocks the COVID-19 Virus, prevents a cytokine storm, heals the lungs and improves blood oxygenation with a mortality reduction of over 90% in the most severe cases.

*Further possible indications*

Possible further indications for RLF-100 are almost all lung affecting diseases, as RLF-100 protects and heals the lungs.

Further RLF-100 acts on RANTES(CCL5) and could be indicated for treatment of HIV, Cancer and other RANTES specific diseases after further studies.

**Current Demand / Demand for Expanded Access**

\- On behalf of Relief Therapeutics, NeuroRX is currently fielding multiple requests from representatives of health ministries, who would like to access RLF-100 for their countries. ^(7)

\- There is currently a high volume of requests for Expanded Access from US licensed physicians ^(8)

**FDA Fast Track &amp; NeuroRX Partnership**

RLFTF has a FDA Fast Track designation for the RLF-100 Drug^(1) all clinical trials and studies are conducted by Relief Therapeutics partner NeuroRX, a privately held US Company. Relief Therapeutics own all rights on RLF-100 and pays NeuroRX to conduct the trials. ^(6)

**Share Price Target**

While it is difficult to determine a Share Price for a Stock which this Potential, my personal calculations put the potential between 5-20$. Analysis see the intermediate Share Price target at 18$ which would be a 3600% increase of the current Price.^(9)

**Catalysts in the near Future**

In the Upcoming Days we expect an announcement of a Partnership with a large drug distribution and logistics Company. ^(10)

1. A Board member of RLFTF saidduring an interview that by October they will be ready to deliver      treatment to 100'000 patients. ^(10)
2. Study Results of the Phase 2/3 Study are due in September. Judged by the Expanded Access data, which treats more severe Cases than in the Study, the results are expected to be very good. ^(10)
3. It is expected that the Data      Monitoring Committee might Stop the study and recommend an approval to the FDA, so that Patients from the Placebo control group can be treated as well.^(10)

**Stock Exchange, Markets and Regulatory Specifics**

RLFTF is registered as RLF.SW at the Swiss Stock Exchange and is subject to swiss exchange law's and regulations. All Management Transactions and Transactions of Significant Shareholders have to be Published according to the Swiss Exchange Regulations.

Publishing of (Corporate) News is only allowed off Market (at least 90 minutes prior to Market opening) if News is published during the Market hours, trading will be suspended for some time. There is little chance with this stock for a late ""jump-on"" once a big catalyst is released, as it will be off-market.

In the US RLFTF is a OTC Traded Stock. RLFTF just filed a OTCQB Application and will therefor also be regulated by the SEC in the future, though i feel the Swiss Regulation is stricter anyway.

**Information about Market Cap, Outstanding Shares and Expected Earnings.**

There was a very comprehensive interview by a Swiss Investment Newspaper covering the Above topics, please check out [https://themarket.ch/interview/relief-therapeutics-our-drug-could-generate-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-per-year-ld.2478](https://themarket.ch/interview/relief-therapeutics-our-drug-could-generate-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-per-year-ld.2478) , it contains almost everything we want to know at this Point.

**Disclaimer**

I follow the clinical development of RLF-100 since the outbreak of SARS-COV-2 and i'm invested since early spring, i see myself as a long term investor. My primary investment motivation is that, after extensive reasearch over months, i believe in the potential of this drug. Please do your own due diligence prior to investment and let me know if you would like to have more information included in this Post, i'll try to update it accordingly.

RLFTF is a Drug Development Company registered at the Swiss Stock Exchange RLF.SW and US OTC Ticker RLFTF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RLFTF&amp;#39;s patented drug RLF-100&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;(Aviptadil/VIP) has a FDA Fast Track designation and is in two Clinical Trials and a FDA Intermediate Expanded Access Program. Preliminary data show a mortality reduction of over 90% in the most critical COVID-19 ICU Patients.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Data and Mechanism of Action - why this is the best COVID-19 drug.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RLF-100(Aviptadil/VIP) has a 30 year research history and is already Approved by some Countries for other Indications (UK Approved for Errectile Dysfunction and EU Orphan drug status for Sarcoidosis treatment *EU designation (EU/3/07/473)), it is already known to be a safe drug with minimal side-effects. &lt;sup&gt;5,6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mechanism Of Action&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RLF-100 inhibits the SARS-COV-2(COVID19) Virus from replicating itself by blocking the      respective receptors. &lt;strong&gt;It is the only known Drug&lt;/strong&gt; so far that &lt;strong&gt;prevents      the Virus from replicating&lt;/strong&gt;(spreading), it act&amp;#39;s preventive and not just symptomatic. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RLF-100 prevents and/or stops the Cytokine Storm, is highly anti-inflamantory and acts on RANTES (CCL5) - in almost the same way that e.g. CYDY&amp;#39;s LL drug does.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RLF-100 is a natural peptide produced and used by the body to protect &amp;amp; heal the lung and to      improve blood oxygenation. Severe CASES of COVID-19 have shown low levels of exactly this Peptide.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clinical Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently there are 2 Clinical Trials underway and a FDA Intermediate Expanded Access Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase 2/3 Trial, IV RLF-100 for Critical COVID-19 Patients, Estimated completion in September 2020 &lt;a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04311697""&gt;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04311697&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDA granted IND for Clinical Trial of RLF-100 in inhaled version with the goal to provide a &lt;strong&gt;preventive treatment at home&lt;/strong&gt; to prevent a moderate/severe COVID-19 infection.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Estimated      completion in November &lt;a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04360096""&gt;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04360096&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDA Intermediate Population Expanded Access of RLF-100, Expanded Access Program for cases too critical to be part of the above studies. In this EAP aims to treat the most critical COVID-19 Patient. &lt;a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04453839""&gt;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04453839&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All currently available Clinical Data regarding COVID-19 is from the Expanded Access. The first 21 Patients showed a Rapid recovery and a mortality reduction of over 90%. This patients consist out of the worst case COVID-19 cases like patients with combined double lung transplant rejection and severe COVID-19 infections. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RLF-100 blocks the COVID-19 Virus, prevents a cytokine storm, heals the lungs and improves blood oxygenation with a mortality reduction of over 90% in the most severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Further possible indications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possible further indications for RLF-100 are almost all lung affecting diseases, as RLF-100 protects and heals the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further RLF-100 acts on RANTES(CCL5) and could be indicated for treatment of HIV, Cancer and other RANTES specific diseases after further studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Demand / Demand for Expanded Access&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- On behalf of Relief Therapeutics, NeuroRX is currently fielding multiple requests from representatives of health ministries, who would like to access RLF-100 for their countries. &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- There is currently a high volume of requests for Expanded Access from US licensed physicians &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FDA Fast Track &amp;amp; NeuroRX Partnership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RLFTF has a FDA Fast Track designation for the RLF-100 Drug&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; all clinical trials and studies are conducted by Relief Therapeutics partner NeuroRX, a privately held US Company. Relief Therapeutics own all rights on RLF-100 and pays NeuroRX to conduct the trials. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share Price Target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is difficult to determine a Share Price for a Stock which this Potential, my personal calculations put the potential between 5-20$. Analysis see the intermediate Share Price target at 18$ which would be a 3600% increase of the current Price.&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catalysts in the near Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Upcoming Days we expect an announcement of a Partnership with a large drug distribution and logistics Company. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Board member of RLFTF saidduring an interview that by October they will be ready to deliver      treatment to 100&amp;#39;000 patients. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study Results of the Phase 2/3 Study are due in September. Judged by the Expanded Access data, which treats more severe Cases than in the Study, the results are expected to be very good. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is expected that the Data      Monitoring Committee might Stop the study and recommend an approval to the FDA, so that Patients from the Placebo control group can be treated as well.&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock Exchange, Markets and Regulatory Specifics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RLFTF is registered as RLF.SW at the Swiss Stock Exchange and is subject to swiss exchange law&amp;#39;s and regulations. All Management Transactions and Transactions of Significant Shareholders have to be Published according to the Swiss Exchange Regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishing of (Corporate) News is only allowed off Market (at least 90 minutes prior to Market opening) if News is published during the Market hours, trading will be suspended for some time. There is little chance with this stock for a late &amp;quot;jump-on&amp;quot; once a big catalyst is released, as it will be off-market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US RLFTF is a OTC Traded Stock. RLFTF just filed a OTCQB Application and will therefor also be regulated by the SEC in the future, though i feel the Swiss Regulation is stricter anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information about Market Cap, Outstanding Shares and Expected Earnings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a very comprehensive interview by a Swiss Investment Newspaper covering the Above topics, please check out &lt;a href=""https://themarket.ch/interview/relief-therapeutics-our-drug-could-generate-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-per-year-ld.2478""&gt;https://themarket.ch/interview/relief-therapeutics-our-drug-could-generate-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-per-year-ld.2478&lt;/a&gt; , it contains almost everything we want to know at this Point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probability of default = Credit Spread/ (1-Recovery Rate)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I am interested in calculating the implied default rate in an ETF. Would this work or should i adjust the formula? Implied default rate = Credit Spread/ (1-Recovery rate)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance&lt;/p&gt;

Since then and many years of disappointment, Blackberry has been slowly transforming into a leader in the software industry, most notably with their QNX technology.

Last year, they had 150 million cars installed with their technology and as of their last earnings report, they increased this number to 175 million which is a growth of 17%.  This is around 30% of the market share of modern cars and upper management projects they can gain up to 60-70% of the market share in the next years.

The automobile industry is down and this has caused Blackberry to go down a bit. However, Blackberry has recently won bids with Hyundai and Volvo which is something to look forward to. Once the automobile industry goes back up, Blackberry will most likely follow.

There is also the promise of 5G coming out soon. As per Blackberry,  5G will lead to more attacks on ""mobile endpoints"". This is where Blackberry comes in as they also have the ""Spark Suites"" which solves this problem. Although they just came out with this platform, it has been very well perceived by their customers.

lastly, they recently announced that Xpeng P7 will be using the QNX Technology. Xpeng is one of the leading electric vehicles in China.  This is great news (which is why it went up 6.28%) as most of their revenues come from North America and this is a great market to expand to.

There are other products that have been doing good for Blackberry (Athoc), but these are the main reasons I am bullish on this stock.

Currently, Blackberry is not seen as innovative since they have been primarily seen as a phone maker, but now they are well diversified in the software business and have been building their products and focusing a lot on R&amp;D. There is great potential for the coming years for Blackberry. This is not a get rich stock but is a hold for the next upcoming years before we see appreciation.

UTZ/CCH MERGER

Listen up smooth brains, I know youre sick of these crazy premiums, and are looking for the next sleeper pick to jump in on, so here it is.

Tomorrow (8/27/20) at 9am a $CCH shareholder vote will be held to merge blank check/spac company Collier Creek Holdings, with Utz Quality Foods snack giant. And im about to tell you why you should put your chips in (no pun intended).  If the vote goes through, the ticker will change to $UTZ. This is the same SPAC merger structure that Draftkings (DKNG) and Nikola Motors (NKLA) and Virgin Galactic (SPCE)

“Why would I bet on a snack company IPO paulbo? That’s not EVs, gambling, or space travel”

**Well, my friend, semiconductor chips aren’t the only kind of chips you can make money on in the stock market, and ill tell you why.** But first, for those who aren’t aware of UTZ, ill give you a little introduction.

Here is the investor Presentation from august 11th for starters: [http://www.colliercreekholdings.com/Cache/IRCache/0de3378d-b2e4-a7dc-9aea-98e51998e5c5.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=0de3378d-b2e4-a7dc-9aea-98e51998e5c5&amp;iid=11139662](http://www.colliercreekholdings.com/Cache/IRCache/0de3378d-b2e4-a7dc-9aea-98e51998e5c5.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=0de3378d-b2e4-a7dc-9aea-98e51998e5c5&amp;iid=11139662)

**What is UTZ Quality Foods?**

Utz Quality Foods, Inc., more commonly known as Utz, is the largest independent, privately held snack food brand in the United States. Based in Hanover, Pennsylvania, the company produces a wide variety of potato chips, pretzels, and other snacks, with most distribution being limited to the eastern United States.

They are a Manufacturer, marketer, and distributor of branded snacks in the U.S., including potato chips, pretzels, cheese snacks, pork skins, pub/party mixes, and veggie snacks  Strong portfolio of national and regional brands, including Utz, Good Health, Boulder Canyon, Zapp’s, and Golden Flake. If you are familiar with any of these absolutely fire snacks, your probably already buying calls and shares. If not, keep reading.

Utz is 99-year-old family company with over 40 years of consecutive Comparable Sales Growth. It’s the #1 largest privately owned snack company up until now, Its #2 salty snack company in its Core geographies; #4 nationally. 2020E Pro Forma Net Sales of $932 million and Projected Further Adj. EBITDA of $124 million. Yes, almost a billion dollars in sales. This is no start up, this is a blue chip, established company that you have the chance to get in on the ground floor, pre-merger.

**It’s Undervalued**

UTZ is being valued at $1.56 billion. They had a billion in sales. Furthermore, If you happened to catch Jim Cramers bit on it, youll have heard him mention how cheap this valuation is. They came to this valuation at an 11.6x multiple of their EBITDA. Competitors like Pepsico (frito lays) are valued at 14.7x.

As you can see, this valuation is very conservative. Especially when you realize how much growth opportunity UTZ has in comparison to its competitors. It has by far the most growth potential.

As you can see in the investor presentation, the growth in the past 20 years has been flawless. Even in recession, it has grown right on cue. Not only is it a growth stock and undervalued, it is also RECESSION PROOF. And it even has a dividend for those boomers out there. Now you can begin to see why this is such a good play.

**There is tons of room to grow at an exponential rate.**

Utz right now is primarily sold in the north east, but they are going public, so that they can go NATIONAL. Imagine buying a future frito lays when it was worth a couple billion.

“Okay fine Paulbo, it’s a great company, but does it have any real hype driving retail buying?”

Surprisingly it does. This is **Boomer King Jim Cramers** favorite snack company as hes from PA. Hes mentioned this multiple times now on his show. He even had the Executives on in July to talk to him, briefly driving the stock price up to 16$ after hours.

**Warren Buffet** even mentioned that UTZ is his favorite snack company, and thought about buying it back in 2015. [https://fortune.com/2015/03/04/warren-buffett-utz/](https://fortune.com/2015/03/04/warren-buffett-utz/)  If Berkshire buys into UTZ, this thing is going to the moon.

Don’t underestimate boomer hype. They have the most buying power of all of retail, and going into the uncertainty of the current world situation with the virus and election season they are going to be looking for a solid blue chip dividend play.

**WHALE MONEY IS BUYING THE SPAC ALREADY**

Institutions like Bamco and Goldman Sachs and cch itslef are currently owning 77% of the public float. That is a higher institutional ownership than any spac ive seen so far. They are making big bets on this company, and most big institutions wont even buy spacs until their mergers are complete. The smart money is going to pile on.

On top of all of these great aspects of UTZ, the most important is that their Pretzels are fucking fire. That fact alone makes this play worth it.

**Final valuation and price targets.**

At ticker change, according to the investor presentation, there will be 110 million shares outstanding. Half of them will be owned by the founding family. The other half will be public float. Of that 55 million, 77% will be owned by the current CCH insiders, and the institutions.

Utz is being valued at 1.5 billion. Undervalued af

If Utz is valued at 15x pro forma 2021 Ebitda of 134m, rather than 11.6x, the market cap would be $2 Billion(still even conservative). That would calculate to  $18.12 at ticker change

As I am writing this, the stock is up to $16 dollars, with a few days before ticker change. This is after trading in the 13.50-14.00 range since they announced the merger earlier this summer. The hype is starting to build, but if youre in under $20 YOU ARE STILL VERY EARLY. This will be fairly valued at $20 within a week maybe two, and itll be at $25 eoy.

Positions:

Warrants

Sept and Oct $15, $17.5, $20 calls

Jan $17.5, $20, $25 calls for a longer play.

TL:DR Utz Quality foods snack giant is merging with a spac and is undervalued by like 30-50%. This company is one of the largest and fastest growing snack companys in the country.  The boomers, jim cramer, warren buffet, dividend ETFS and fat people from the north east are going to be loving this stock. Super low risk and a possible high reward with warrants or calls. Premiums are still low on calls, and there is a ton of upside. The company also makes fire pretzels and cheeseballs.",t2_lj8xn,False,,0,False,CCH/UTZ Merger DD UTZ quality foods,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ihczb8,False,dark,0.86,,public,33,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,33,,True,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598524801.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post was meant for WSB but they dont let you post spacs i guess, so i hope you guys appreciate&lt;/p&gt;

This will be fairly valued at $20 within a week maybe two, and itll be at $25 eoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warrants&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept and Oct $15, $17.5, $20 calls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan $17.5, $20, $25 calls for a longer play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL:DR Utz Quality foods snack giant is merging with a spac and is undervalued by like 30-50%. This company is one of the largest and fastest growing snack companys in the country.  The boomers, jim cramer, warren buffet, dividend ETFS and fat people from the north east are going to be loving this stock. Super low risk and a possible high reward with warrants or calls. Premiums are still low on calls, and there is a ton of upside. The company also makes fire pretzels and cheeseballs.&lt;/p&gt;

I am sitting on a 200% gain from a mid March purchase of a covid high flying tech stock.  If I sell now, I lock in the profit, but the trade will be taxed as a ""short term capital gain (STCG)"".  If I sell for the same price in March 2021 the trade counts as a ""long term capital gain (LTCG)"" and my tax bill is significantly smaller.  However, the earnings report for the stock is a month away, covid news ranges from promising to dreary daily and there is election on the horizon.  The stock could continue to be a high flyer or come crashing down based on any of those factors.  For the sake of argument, lets say the difference in the tax bill between STCG and LTCG is $20K.  

Lets talk about options for protecting this position while maximizing tax savings:

1. Conservative Approach - Sell now, pocket the money but pay STCG - this has an opportunity cost of $20K (the difference between STCG and LTCG)
2. Buy ""insurance"" to protect against a significant drop in price - Buying March 2021 ""puts"" at the current strike price to cover the position will cost about $500. If the price stays the same or goes up, the put expires worthless and I loose $500 but avoid paying the $20K STCG/LTCG differential.   
This seems like a no-brainer way to protect a position long enough to recover the tax differential.
   1.  Not so fast!  It turns out the options trade itself has the same STCG/LTCG problem if it makes money.  So, if the position drops by $100K and I exercise the put, the position is protected, but I owe STCG (.35) on the $100K gain from the put.  
3. Plan for significant volatility -  Setting up a March 2021 options straddle   (buying puts and calls at the current strike price) will cost approximately $1000, but it has the benefit of protecting the position in the event of a huge decline and providing even more exposure to a big price increase. If price stays the same, but the put and all expire worthless and I am out $1K (still significantly better than the $20K differential)
   1. Again I will have a STCG problem on the option itself

**Just Some Anecdotes &amp; Similarities**

* We are seeing some very notable divergences in the market, where the leaders are making up all the attribution of gains, and the laggards are falling further and further behind. This frequently precedes significant drawdowns.
* We are coming off a period where the dollar going into a notable downtrend in relatively quick fashion, and then started to either form a bottom or consolidation. This too happened in 2018 - dollar strength tends to be risk off, and dollar weakness tends to be great for risk assets.

* Volatility starting to grind higher ***despite*** the fact that markets are similarly moving higher.
* Put to call ratio hitting extremely low levels at a time when stocks are strongly overbought.
* Record lows in short interest in major market indexes

2. ""Monthly data on China RevPAR from STR has recovered to -14% y/y last week, essentially back to more ""normal"" recession levels. The trend echoes commentary from Hyatt, Hilton, Marriott and Wyndham noting that travel behavior has returned to patterns more consistent with pre-COVID levels, including a nascent rebound in business transient. These comments were bolstered by reports that the China Beauty Expo saw only a 10% decline in visitation for the convention, which normally attracts over 100k participants. The improvement in RevPAR has also been consistent with the OECD leading indicator for China, which has been a \~3-6 month leading indicator for RevPAR. In our view, the consistency of the correlation suggests that behavior has not permanently changed and could continue to improve in the months ahead. **With China's COVID case pattern about 6-9 months ahead of the US (barring no further waves), the trends could imply US trends are back to normalized levels by mid-2021, far more bullish than our estimates or consensus.**""

,investing,"Hi, my strategy is pretty aggressive as I (successfuly for now), buying IPOs when I like them and feel like they will be pumped and hyped. 

I also own blue chips such as AMZN, AAPL, MSFT and stuff like TSLA, AMD, NVDA. 

I have over 25k € invested right now and I am adding ~2k € each month

This was a but of background.

Now. What wpuld be the reasons against taking a loan to buy more stocks?

Example: I can take 10k € for 5 years, paying almost 11.5k € back. So ~1.5k extra. If I can keep 7% return from stocks, I can earn that 1.5k in like 2 years. And this example has pretty high interest rate on bank side. So if I can get loan cheaper, it could be in 1 year or 1.5 year..

&lt;p&gt;I also own blue chips such as AMZN, AAPL, MSFT and stuff like TSLA, AMD, NVDA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have over 25k € invested right now and I am adding ~2k € each month&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a but of background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now. What wpuld be the reasons against taking a loan to buy more stocks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: I can take 10k € for 5 years, paying almost 11.5k € back. So ~1.5k extra. If I can keep 7% return from stocks, I can earn that 1.5k in like 2 years. And this example has pretty high interest rate on bank side. So if I can get loan cheaper, it could be in 1 year or 1.5 year..&lt;/p&gt;

If Powell has his way, he will try to increase inflation to something like 4-5% to stimulate the economy

The way to increase inflation is that 

1. treasury creates bonds, 

2. treasury sells them to banks, (banks make profit on interest), 

3. they sell the bonds to banks, 

4. the  feds  write a cheque, 

5. the banks then get treasury to print more money while cashing in their cheques.

,investing,"I read an article that claimed that Bitcoin tended to lead stocks market changes, but this was the usual tea leaf reading and chart-staring.

So I decided to compute the cross-correlation function of daily bitcoin percentage changes with SP500 daily percentage changes, from 2015 to today.

Plot here: https://i.imgur.com/zNHSzZK.png

The big white peak shows that bitcoin and stocks move in parallel on the same day (zero time lag).

But the broad bump in the red boxcar-smoothed correlation function suggests that bitcoin prices changes today are correlated with SP500 changes over the upcoming week.   

However the SP500 seems to have little or no predictive power for Bitcoin, because there's no peak to the left of zero.


---- 

NOTE: the [cross-correlation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation) is defined as  

c(t) = ∫ 𝝙BTC(𝜏 )/BTC((𝜏 ) ⨉ 𝝙SP500(𝜏 +t)/SP500(𝜏 +t)d𝜏   

so that if BTC(𝜏 ) tends move the same as SP500(𝜏+t) for many  𝜏 then c(t) should have a peak at t.

-----

edit - a simple hypothesis:  The zero-lag (white) correlation is obviously just normal correlated markets. The longer (red) correlation represents an internal lag time to the stock market in responding to events.  For example a negative event causes a crash in both BTC and SP500.  The Bitcoin falls fast, and stops, but SP500 reacts slowly and the sell-off  takes a few days to complete.    

As an analogy, an earthquake knocks down a building (BTC), and also sets off a huge landslide (SP500), but the big landslide tends to be followed by a series of smaller landslides.     The building's fall ""predicted"" the multi-day landslide, but it's not a useful prediction, because you could have looked at the initial landslide and known that more landslides tend to follow.

&lt;p&gt;edit - a simple hypothesis:  The zero-lag (white) correlation is obviously just normal correlated markets. The longer (red) correlation represents an internal lag time to the stock market in responding to events.  For example a negative event causes a crash in both BTC and SP500.  The Bitcoin falls fast, and stops, but SP500 reacts slowly and the sell-off  takes a few days to complete.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an analogy, an earthquake knocks down a building (BTC), and also sets off a huge landslide (SP500), but the big landslide tends to be followed by a series of smaller landslides.     The building&amp;#39;s fall &amp;quot;predicted&amp;quot; the multi-day landslide, but it&amp;#39;s not a useful prediction, because you could have looked at the initial landslide and known that more landslides tend to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit 2: a technical way of saying this is that the SP500 might have a longer &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_response#Economics""&gt;impulse response&lt;/a&gt; to external events than BTC.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"I'm looking into STOR and GOOD, two REITs, and MAIN, a business development company. These are all fairly popular in the retail investing community since they pay monthly dividends and I'm curious to know if anyone else is investing into them or has divested from them owing to the consequences of covid?

STOR was bought again by Berkshire, which is a keen sign of confidence. They also seem to own a lot of property that will remain valuable (and rentable) and focus their selections on properties that run profitable locations for their tenants, so that suggests their tenants would not want to move locations lightly. My next purchase, soon, after I was able to read more about the after initially thinking they'd crater.

GOOD and MAIN I know less about. GOOD runs long term leases for factories and office buildings (I know). They did seem to pull out of the last recession very well. Of course there were different reasons for their last crash and I can see hesitation about the effects of covid on the companies that lease their offices, especially the kinds that can adapt to working from home. I still think companies want to maintain some sort of physical footprint and if the leasing prices are in line with the surrounding areas they'll probably stay rather than go pure WFH. Their industrial buildings are probably safer, as they sure are ugly, and run businesses that cannot be worked remotely.

MAIN is a business development company. It pulled out of the last recession nicely--when the world of finance really kicked out a lot of players in the market--which suggests to me they will also do all right when their target businesses are struggling.

,investing,"Hey everyone, I recently got this options strategy from this company based in the US called the Nanban Foundation. It seems very promising, but it took a while to understand it (the English was a bit broken). I managed to translate it, and I need help evaluating this. From my rough calculations it seems this can make around 100-170 dollars a week with the initial investment being 2000 dollars. That would mean an average return of about 260% to 440%!!!. I think this might be too good to be true. Please let me know what you guys think!

Anyway, here it is:

This is for SPY STOCK (S&amp;P 500)

1. SELL a PUT (with a strike at 5 dollars above the current market price of SPY) and SELL a CALL (with a strike at 5 dollars below the current market price of SPY) both for a Premium ($X)

2. BUY a PUT for a premium of 20% of $X

3. BUY a CALL for a premium of 10% of $X

4. Create CLOSING ORDERS for Step 1 by spending 10% of $X. For example, If $X=1.00, create a CLOSING ORDER for when the SELL PUT and SELL CALL’s premium reaches 0.90.

5. Create a CLOSING ORDER for Step 2 when the premium quadruples.

6. Create a CLOSING ORDER for Step 3 when the premium doubles or quadruples.

7. If the CLOSING ORDER for step 5 executes, repeat steps 2, 5, 7 except when repeating step 2, you have to do it for a premium of 20% of the premium of the EXECUTED CLOSING ORDER. If not, disregard this step.

8. If the CLOSING ORDER for step 6 executes, repeat steps 3, 6, 8 except when repeating step 3, you have to do it for a premium of 10% of the premium of the EXECUTED CLOSING ORDER. If not, disregard this step.

This is quite attractive for self-funded employers, who often don't have the money reserved to deal with unexpected health crisis.

I'm sure covid-19 won't be the last pandemic that the world will face (in fact, Bill Gates has warned us for years about this).

And with the immense Google tech backing it, Coefficient Insurance can easily tailor its insurance policy to meet the need/risk of each employer.

I believe this is the right move for Google given the current circumstance and the rising hype about online data-driven insurance-related business (ie,  LMND and DCT). So I expect more upside to Google stock in the near future.

Because I did that, I'm now on their free newsletter as well, and they started REALLY hyping this thing they were calling the SuperBull Summit where he was going to talk about his strategies for picking stocks that will make massive gains over the coming years. They kept sending out reminders about this event for over a week so I decided to watch it to see if it had anything good to say. I don't know how heavily attended it was, so maybe none of you know what I'm talking about.

Anyway, it turns out that it was just an hour-long advertisement for another one of his advising packages called ""Extreme Fortunes"" to which he offered a small discount and a meaningless guarantee... He did however talk about a handful of stocks that he thinks are going to be huge winners over the coming years including one that he said he has never been more bullish on. He didn't mention what they actually are because he wants you to buy his service, but I wanted to see if we could reason out what they were based on what he said.

I'm not sure if it will work or not, but the topics I'm bringing up are at 1:06:26-1:12:20 (for the #1 stock he thinks will go up over 1000% in the coming years) and 1:13:44-1:15:58 (for his other 5 stocks he anticipates acting similarly). Don't watch the rest, it's a waste of time.

**I'm nearly positive that his #1 stock is AXTI because the costs match up, the CEO matches his description, and they sell the same products he mentions. I bought $300 of it, we'll see what happens. Do what you will with that info.**

In addition to that though, he was pretty vague about 5 other stocks. I took a screenshot ([link](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Mjdw991DE1y5LirXA)) of the description for the 5 companies. I'm wondering if we can decode which companies he is thinking of. Here is what he said about each one that isn't on the image:

1. Breakthrough for continuous glucose monitoring with minimal maintenance for consumers. Technology is 12x more resilient than competitors. Has received financing from Blackrock and Oppenheimer. Priced at ""almost nothing right now.""
2. Twice the effectiveness of competitors in atrial fibrillation treatment. In the last few years, revenue has more than quadrupled.
3. Smart tech used currently in cars and offices with the promise of being used in smart buildings in the future.
4. Proprietary modular technology to cut corporate energy expenses in half. US Department of Energy declared that this technology will have a dynamic impact on the world's energy consumption.
5. ""Internet of things"" revolution. The company estimates this tech could soon connect trillions of devices around the world. They are a leader in a market that is estimated to grow almost 500% in a few years.

I'm wondering if Abbott meets the criteria for #2 or maybe even #1. I'm curious to hear if any of these sound familiar to you. Any guesses what they could be?

I don&amp;#39;t know how heavily attended it was, so maybe none of you know what I&amp;#39;m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it turns out that it was just an hour-long advertisement for another one of his advising packages called &amp;quot;Extreme Fortunes&amp;quot; to which he offered a small discount and a meaningless guarantee... He did however talk about a handful of stocks that he thinks are going to be huge winners over the coming years including one that he said he has never been more bullish on. He didn&amp;#39;t mention what they actually are because he wants you to buy his service, but I wanted to see if we could reason out what they were based on what he said.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;m not sure if it will work or not, but the topics I&amp;#39;m bringing up are at 1:06:26-1:12:20 (for the #1 stock he thinks will go up over 1000% in the coming years) and 1:13:44-1:15:58 (for his other 5 stocks he anticipates acting similarly). Don&amp;#39;t watch the rest, it&amp;#39;s a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m nearly positive that his #1 stock is AXTI because the costs match up, the CEO matches his description, and they sell the same products he mentions. I bought $300 of it, we&amp;#39;ll see what happens. Do what you will with that info.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to that though, he was pretty vague about 5 other stocks. I took a screenshot (&lt;a href=""https://photos.app.goo.gl/Mjdw991DE1y5LirXA""&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) of the description for the 5 companies. I&amp;#39;m wondering if we can decode which companies he is thinking of. Here is what he said about each one that isn&amp;#39;t on the image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breakthrough for continuous glucose monitoring with minimal maintenance for consumers. Technology is 12x more resilient than competitors. Has received financing from Blackrock and Oppenheimer. Priced at &amp;quot;almost nothing right now.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twice the effectiveness of competitors in atrial fibrillation treatment. In the last few years, revenue has more than quadrupled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart tech used currently in cars and offices with the promise of being used in smart buildings in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proprietary modular technology to cut corporate energy expenses in half. US Department of Energy declared that this technology will have a dynamic impact on the world&amp;#39;s energy consumption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Internet of things&amp;quot; revolution. The company estimates this tech could soon connect trillions of devices around the world. They are a leader in a market that is estimated to grow almost 500% in a few years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m wondering if Abbott meets the criteria for #2 or maybe even #1. I&amp;#39;m curious to hear if any of these sound familiar to you. Any guesses what they could be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be fun to hack the system he&amp;#39;s trying to entice you with. If we can figure them out, they might present some good opportunities as well. We&amp;#39;ll see. Thanks for humoring me, and happy investing.&lt;/p&gt;

I know that with an iron condor strategy you make money when the price of the underlying stock is greater than the short put strike - premium and less than the short call strike + premium.

Let’s say that the value of the underlying stock falls outside that range before expiration—we mitigate our loss using a buy call and buy put with the iron condor strategy. But in the end we still suffer a set loss.

My question is, can we avoid that loss by setting close orders for the buy calls and buy puts that activate when the premiums of those contracts increase buy 4 times and then just setting up a new buy call/put for a premium for the same price as the initial buy put and call?

For example, let’s say the value of XYZ stock is 75 dollars at the beginning of the iron condor trade. Then we engage in an iron condor trade with a BUY 60 PUT @ 1.00, SELL 65 PUT @ 2.00, SEL 85 CALL @ 2.00, BUY 90 CALL @ 1.00. After a few days, let’s say that the price of the XYZ stock is increasing more than we expect and it’s approaching 90. What if we just close the BUY 90 CALL option before XYZ hits the strike price of the BUY 90 CALL and then immediately enter a BUY 95 CALL?

Through this method, I think we would be able to completely remove any loss. But I feel like this is too good to be true. Is there a catch to this method?

# U.S. Poised to Charge Teva in Generic Drugs Price-Fixing Probe

Aug. 25, 2020, 2:16 PM

U.S. prosecutors are preparing to charge Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. with conspiring with competitors to raise prices for generic drugs, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The Justice Department is planning to charge Teva as soon as Tuesday after the company rebuffed a settlement that would have required paying a criminal penalty and admitting wrongdoing, said the person, who declined to be named because the matter is confidential.

A spokesperson for Teva, which is based in Israel, declined to comment.

# Drug firm bets it won't be charged

In the coming days, the Justice Department will decide whether to file criminal charges against one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies suspected of colluding with rivals to inflate the prices of widely used drugs.

The company, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, is betting that in the middle of a deadly pandemic, the Trump administration won't dare to come down hard on the largest supplier of generic drugs in the United States.

It is a high-stakes gamble that could affect millions of Americans who rely on Teva's dozens of inexpensive generic drugs, as well as its brand-name products like Copaxone, for multiple sclerosis, and Ajovy, for migraines. Teva officials say criminal charges could cripple the Israeli company and potentially leave it unable to sell drugs to federal programs like Medicare.

For years, the Justice Department and state prosecutors have been investigating what they describe as a conspiracy by pharmaceutical companies to increase the prices of popular drugs. The department has already extracted guilty pleas and $224 million in penalties from four other drug companies.

Lawyers for Teva, which prosecutors believe was deeply involved in the conspiracy, until recently had been holding settlement negotiations with officials in the Justice Department's antitrust division. But in April, the company all but walked away from the talks, according to people on both sides of the discussions.",t2_112r0h,False,,0,False,ALERT -- TEVA Charged For Generic Drugs Price-Fixing Probe,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_igibr1,False,dark,0.55,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,1598385013.0,,[],{},,True,,1598409877.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run for your life ...&lt;/p&gt;

FCF = Net Income - CapEx

Which seems to be the accepted equation. 

However, I recently came across a BioTech company which has negative Cash From Investing (all of which comes under the section Investments). 

Why is this not included in the calculation of FCF? Surely if they spent more cash on investments than they earned back, this loss affects their FCF?

The company in question has no CapEx or PP&amp;E on their Cash Flow statement.

So what does ""Investments"" actually entail in this case? Securities? I'm not sure why the company would be spending cash on securities rather than capital.  On the balance sheet, the majority of their assets are short-term investments. Is this normal in BioTech?

Sales of newly built homes soared across the nation in July, as pent-up demand from the shutdown spring market, urban flight and a new desire for more work-at-home space fueled the growth.

As measured by signed contracts, new home sales jumped 13.9% compared with June and were a remarkable 36.3% higher annually, according to the U.S. Census. June’s reading was also revised higher. This is the strongest one-month pace since 2006.

This is the third consecutive month of sizable sales gains, after sales dropped dramatically in March and April, due to the onset of the [coronavirus pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/25/coronavirus-live-updates.html). 

Strong demand sucked up the inventory of newly built homes for sale, which fell to a four-month supply from a 4.7-month supply in June. 

“The new home market has everything going for it right now including limited resale supply, fear of missing out, heightened dissatisfaction of our current living situation, low mortgage rates, months of saving money, and increased demand from key demographic cohorts,” said Ali Wolf, chief economist at Meyers Research.

Low supply and strong demand made it easier for builders to raise prices. The median price of a newly built home sold in July was $330,600, an increase of 7.2% compared with July 2019.

“With larger homes, greener backyards, garages and home offices ranking at the top of home buyers’ lists, new homes in the suburbs fit the bill and have been a welcome answer to a housing market parched for existing inventory,” said George Ratiu, senior economist at realtor.com. “Builders have recognized the acute need for more construction and have moved to fill the gap. The main concern hovering over the market is whether the rising costs of building materials will drive prices even higher.”

Lumber prices are up more than 100% since mid-April, as mills shut down in the spring and did not expect to see such strong demand so quickly. There are also higher tariffs on imports of lumber.

Buyers are taking advantage of low mortgage rates, which give them additional purchasing power but also tend to juice home prices. The average rate on the 30-year fixed set two record lows in July, when these sales contracts were signed.

Regionally, sales gains were strongest in the Midwest and the South but dropped in the Northeast on a monthly basis. The Northeast tends to be the most volatile read, as it has the smallest concentration of new construction.

,investing,"Goldman hosted a virtual investor meeting yesterday with $DAL\* CEO Ed Bastian and CFO Paul Jacobson. The discussions focused on demand recovery and the company's ability to adapt costs to the uncertain demand outlook. Here are the key takeaways:

1. Commenting on the current demand environment, management noted that this has held relatively steady at down \~75% year-over-year for the last four to six weeks, underlying which business demand remains down a more depressed -86% to -88% year-over-year. However, more recently the company has seen a very modest uptick in bookings, likely driven in part by the upcoming Labor Day holiday weekend. Given that bookings remain relatively close-in, the company does not currently have much clarity around fall demand, but expects to have a better view post-Labor Day.
2. Due to ongoing demand uncertainty, the company remains committed to its flexible planning approach. Currently, Delta’s planning guardrails are for summer 2021 capacity to be down 20% to 40% vs. 2019 levels. If the demand recovery by summer 2021 requires a capacity cut of greater than 40%, the company believes there is room to flex down further. However, if demand were to recover in a more V-shaped fashion than most airline managements and we believe is likely, it would be difficult for Delta to cut capacity less than 20% given previously announced headcount reductions and aircraft retirements.
3. Delta anticipates that its unit costs (“CASM”) coming out of the crisis will be lower than pre-COVID levels given various cost savings across the organization, including labor and the fleet. On the former, the company highlighted that 17,000 employees, or \~20% of its workforce, have already elected to participate in voluntary retirement/separation programs. The majority of participants in these programs were more senior and therefore at the higher end of the pay scale, which should result in lower labor costs even as Delta/the industry scale back up as demand recovers, further aided by productivity gains the company is planning to leverage. With respect to fleet-driven savings, management highlighted its previously announced aircraft retirement plans would accelerate its fleet simplification process and reduce expenses going forward tied to improved fuel burn, fewer training events, reduced spare parts inventory, etc.
4. With Delta planning for both capacity and costs to be down \~50% year-over-year in the Dec Q, the company continues to anticipate that further cash burn improvement will largely hinge on demand. However, management commented that potential further fleet simplification actions could drive additional costs out of the business.
5. Delta reiterated that it does not currently plan to draw on its loan allocation under the current CARES Act given the associated restrictions and as it has other options to raise additional liquidity if necessary. Looking forward, there have been discussions of a potential airline provision in a new proposed stimulus package (or “CARES 2”), which could include an extension of the Payroll Support Program (currently slated to end September 30th). Management noted that these discussions, which started out as a union-driven initiative, have bipartisan support in the US government and that a relatively larger CARES 2 package would increase the likelihood of the airlines provision being included.
6. Management currently does not plan to back away from its long-standing strategy to strengthen its global network through partnerships with various international airlines.

The discussions focused on demand recovery and the company&amp;#39;s ability to adapt costs to the uncertain demand outlook. Here are the key takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commenting on the current demand environment, management noted that this has held relatively steady at down ~75% year-over-year for the last four to six weeks, underlying which business demand remains down a more depressed -86% to -88% year-over-year. However, more recently the company has seen a very modest uptick in bookings, likely driven in part by the upcoming Labor Day holiday weekend. Given that bookings remain relatively close-in, the company does not currently have much clarity around fall demand, but expects to have a better view post-Labor Day.&lt;/li&gt;

The Conference Board said on Tuesday its consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 84.8 this month from 91.7 in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index edging up to a reading of 93 in August.

[BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/?utm_source=BusinessWire&amp;utm_medium=pressrelease&amp;utm_campaign=InstagramCheckout)   (Nasdaq: BIGC), a leading open SaaS ecommerce platform for  fast-growing  and established brands, today announced the availability  of [checkout on Instagram](https://business.instagram.com/shopping/checkout)   for eligible US merchants. BigCommerce merchants can be among the  first  to adopt the new feature, which provides shoppers an intuitive,   seamless and secure way to purchase products they discover on Instagram   in a few clicks, without leaving the app.

Leveraging   BigCommerce’s native integration with Facebook Commerce Manager,   merchants can easily connect their ecommerce storefront’s catalog to   Instagram and give customers the ability to buy from their favorite   brands directly on Instagram—rather than navigating to a brand’s website   to make a purchase—and pay using PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, American   Express or Discover. After placing an order, customers can also use the   Instagram app to view their order status, estimated delivery date and   tracking number, as well as cancel orders, initiate returns or request   additional support.

""Creating  a  streamlined checkout experience is paramount for merchants looking to   social commerce to drive revenue growth. The rollout of checkout on   Instagram is another significant step in Instagram’s evolution toward   becoming an essential commerce channel for customer-focused brands,""   said Brent Bellm, chief executive officer at BigCommerce.

,investing,"Rinse, repeat; SFH values and equities going up in lockstep but then what? How or does this land smoothly?

If you buy in now (equities and homes) and the value floor drops, THEN soon after that point you know we will be told inflation is “showing” it’s ugly head. Per the usual script, raising interest rates will be the “only tool” to tame it, they’ll say. I cannot see how inflation is not going to rise in the next 3 to 5 years and briskly. 

Some are selling all these stocks people are clamoring to buy. Why are they selling now? 

This time we live in is a little different than 1999; when have you seen a narrative so singular (Covid), SFH values going up and real estate reserves low with equities skyrocketing simultaneously? The world has supposedly stopped spinning yet we’re spending like it’s going out-of-style?

Back then, it was the dotcom bubble. Remember CMGI? Now it’s 5G (remember that?), COVID stimulus,  brisk SFH sales supported by cheap money (low interest rates) and more common folk and fanboys investing in stocks.  The last part of the previous sentence explains why Apple just had a stock split.   

To me, there is a rush to get you locked in to your financial torture device of choice because the table has been set and the feast is coming but your not eating.  When the music stops, only interest rates will be used to “help”.  I’m old enough to remember 23% interest rates on apartment buildings. So many will be stuck in upside down homes and equities while a segment will wait and buy up when some can’t wait any longer.

How or does this land smoothly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you buy in now (equities and homes) and the value floor drops, THEN soon after that point you know we will be told inflation is “showing” it’s ugly head. Per the usual script, raising interest rates will be the “only tool” to tame it, they’ll say. I cannot see how inflation is not going to rise in the next 3 to 5 years and briskly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some are selling all these stocks people are clamoring to buy. Why are they selling now? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time we live in is a little different than 1999; when have you seen a narrative so singular (Covid), SFH values going up and real estate reserves low with equities skyrocketing simultaneously? The world has supposedly stopped spinning yet we’re spending like it’s going out-of-style?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back then, it was the dotcom bubble. Remember CMGI? Now it’s 5G (remember that?), COVID stimulus,  brisk SFH sales supported by cheap money (low interest rates) and more common folk and fanboys investing in stocks.  The last part of the previous sentence explains why Apple just had a stock split.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, there is a rush to get you locked in to your financial torture device of choice because the table has been set and the feast is coming but your not eating.  When the music stops, only interest rates will be used to “help”.  I’m old enough to remember 23% interest rates on apartment buildings. So many will be stuck in upside down homes and equities while a segment will wait and buy up when some can’t wait any longer.  The same as it’s always been, just way more synchronized than ever before.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History will show one thing though that sticks out like a very sore thumb; why did 2007/2008 happen yet again so soon.  Apparently, life moves so fast now, we can’t remember 12 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

Interested in any feedback from investors who have a decent portion of their wealth in cryptocurrency and are utilizing DeFi. If you're not familiar with the term, in the crypto money community, DeFi (Decentralized Finance) encompasses sets of protocols which fill the roles of a central bank. An entire ""crypto banking"" layer has evolved on top of assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) that allow users to:

(a) Remain in full control &amp; possession of their assets by utilizing offline storage &amp; hardware wallets.  
(b) Allow for lending, borrowing, trading, and earning interest on crypto assets.

I think it's apparent—in the US at least—that there's really no intrinsic value to the dollar, most people do not have money, simply currency. I can't help but feel that between public awareness of how markets work, COVID, extreme partisanship in government and a calculated effort by the Federal Reserve to devalue the $USD through QE that soon the bubble is going to burst, and it's time to pay the piper. The magnitude of the $USD collapse would be catastrophic for anyone left holding the bag (most people).

Is there anyone who has a large share of their wealth in cryptocurrency that has tested the waters of DeFi?

I am particularly interested in feedback from those who have placed a good portion of their net worth into crypto banking systems, actively taking part in lending, asset pools, governance, or any other ""bankless"" financial system. Understanding that this whole sector is far from mature:

* Has anything struck you as being a major flaw in the setup of crypto banking as it stands?
* Do you feel (assuming proper precautions of utilizing hardware wallets/key ownership are followed) that your assets are as secure within DeFi systems as they are just being held in your wallet?
* With maturation, do you believe DeFi will surpass traditional markets?

Just getting started looking into moving cryptocurrency holdings into DeFi systems, so any and all constructive advice would be appreciated!

Just some backstory:

I have another 5000 in the bank right now which I probably will put into a Roth IRA, investing in some growth stocks I guess? Completely tax free :). Haven’t totally thought that part through 100% yet so not sure about what investments I will pursue there

&gt;Due to current state restrictions, investors who reside in certain states (AK, FL, NC, NM, NY, PA) have limited investment access to Notes and can only purchase Notes through the secondary market. Once Folio discontinues the secondary platform, these investors will not be able to invest in Notes.

Right now at the bank combined witt my savings account and checking account i have accumulated  $290,000 dollars. Financial advisors have told me that to grow my wealth over the long term the stock market is a good place to put it, and diversifying with other financial assets. Always my answer to them has always being to reject all their offer, and just put my money like it is now, more safe and at reach when i needed with the bank. Financial advisors had referre me to mutual funds, eres, and bond funds, for all of them i had completely rejected and say no.

I believe the recent lawsuit is actually brought on by another network who sees them as a threat, or wants to lower their value to potentially buy them out. While I see it as an entry point for all.

The stock spiked on every one of these announcements. $1 to $11 on June 3rd, another spike on July 2nd, and again on Aug 3rd. It hasn't stayed, but it seems we are due for another at any moment (End of Aug/beginning of Sept?) I believe this is a great company with massive growth potential. Due to their recent collaboration with Amazon Prime, I believe they will get picked up or bought out by Amazon, (if not Viacom or ATT due to their quickly growing threat to Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network).

Been looking into ETFs and dividend stocks as i think they would give more of a return than my .05% savings account...

I was wondering how covered calls work with dividends however, i haven't found a straightforward answer.

I own 100 shares of XOM.

I sell covered calls each week to increase my return.

What happens if:

1. I sell my call before the ex-dividend date and it hits the strike and i lose my shares
2. I sell my call after the ex-dividend date and it hits the strike and i lose my shares

Im pretty sure if i sell calls before or after and they expire, ill still get my dividend but i was curious how losing them works.

Im also imagining if i sell puts before purchasing the stock, i just need to actually own 100 shares before the ex-dividend date, and then switch to covered calls until the dividend date passes?

,investing,"First of all here is my prediction for your reference](https://imgur.com/0pgx22Z)

Let’s start with vehicles:


Tesla is at the forefront of the technological and EV revolution. They have first mover advantage and a large arsenal of capital behind them to dominate the EV field. At the moment Tesla has 7 billion in cash and 14 billion in long term obligations. This may seem like a problem, however with the current share price Tesla can dilute even just 1% of shareholders and be in a much better financial position. 
Additionally, Elon Musk is close to the third tranche of his performance bonus. Once that comes into play, he will have the option to purchase 1.69 million shares at a price of $350 each. This will further add $600 million to Tesla’s balance sheet. 
Tesla is in a unique position to release a new line of vehicles that will sell well in certain markets. For example, the Cyber Truck in America. It can create a cheaper compact model for Europe. It’s China presence is growing tremendously and Tesla has the backing of the CCP.
As you can see Tesla is in a presiding position to be the market leader in the EV space.


 Batteries:

Tesla’s purchase of Maxwell Technologies in May of 2019 secures Its role as a battery manufacturer. By creating the batteries for its vehicles in-house Tesla will improve its profit margins and be at the forefront of revolutionizing battery technology. This puts Tesla in a unique position to manufacture batteries not only for itself, but also for EV vehicles of other manufacturers. This is yet an untapped revenue source that will surely be fruitful in the future. 


Super Charger Network:

Tesla is the only EV vehicle that you can drive from NY to LA by using its network of supercharger stations. This gives Tesla a definite advantage over other EVs and relieves the range anxiety people may experience. Additionally building such a network costs billions of dollars and it is unlikely that other manufacturers will undertake this. Because of this, as EV cars become more prominent than ICE cars, Tesla will open up its network to other manufacturers and this will yet be another untapped revenue source.


Energy:

Tesla’s energy business is in its infantile stages and is set to become a revenue powerhouse over the next decade. It’s success in Australia has demonstrated a value add of its powerpack technology. Tesla installed a 100MW battery farm that stores energy from wind and solar power sources. This allows the surrounding area to not be affected by temporary blips of power outage and ensures an even distribution of power across the entire power grid. This technology is being underutilized and as the world moves towards solar and wind it will be vital. California is one example where only using solar and wind power sources has caused rolling blackout issues, but with the implementation of Tesla’s battery plant that will be a thing of the past.


RoboTaxi Network:

Elon Musk stated that Level 5 autonomy will be possible for Tesla vehicles within 1 year, now if this statement is overzealous surely LV5 will be available sometime within the next 5 years. Once this happens Tesla will begin the rollout of its robo taxi network. This will become essentially another powerhouse of a revenue source and will propel Tesla into a dominating conglomerate. 


Finals Thoughts:

Will all the exciting things about Tesla, it is surely still early innings for Tesla and the future this company will bring is revolutionary to mankind. Right now we are at the forefront of the next most valuable company on earth. Its capital position has strengthened dramatically and it has first mover advantage. It has resources behind it that other car manufacturers can only dream of, it has untapped revenue sources, its innovation is one that only a visionary founder can set forth, it has the backing of governments worldwide.

,investing,"**TLDR at the bottom**

As the title states, it is my opinion that SOAC warrants (SOAC.WT) are a great target for investors trying to get into the ESG sector. This is not financial advice. Do your own DD and make your own decisions.

**Objective:**

SOAC is Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation. It is a $300 million blank check company with a dedicated ESG focus. ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. As their [website](https://www.greenspac.com/) states, SOAC is ""focused on evaluating suitable targets that have existing environmental sustainability practices.""

**Opinion:**

I believe that ESG has a strong impact on the market today. Just think bout some of the examples below and how it can affect the public's perception of a company and also how it can affect a company's stock.

**E** for Environmental: climate change, carbon emissions, air and water pollution, energy efficiency

**S** for Social: gender and diversity, community relations, human rights, labor standards

**G** for Governance: company leadership, shareholder rights, company standards

SOAC is one of the first (if not the first) blank check company to have an ESG focus ([source](https://www.greenspac.com/wp-content/uploads/news/first-of-its-kind-sustainable-spac-raises-$300m-environmental-finance.pdf))

**Opinion:**

Whether you want to believe it or not, ESG will continue to have an impact on investing for years and years to come. This could be due to a number of reasons including the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice, among others. Here are some links for further reading about ESG:

**Objective:**

What type of companies/targets would SOAC look for? It turns out from their website, it can mean a target in a variety of industries such as ""manufacturing (including auto, building materials), chemicals, services (including waste, environmental, construction), logistics (including transportation, distribution), technology (hardware, software, devices), agriculture (including biofuels) and energy (with focus on renewable generation, utility services, energy efficiency/management), among others."" They also state they could target companies that historically have not been focused on environmental sustainability but are now looking to enhance their environmental sustainability profiles.

**Opinion:**

Think about some of the ""hot"" investments sectors right now. I'm talking about auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy.....these could be where SOAC's target comes from.

Many people will say that for blank check companies, the management team or the amount in the trust fund is the most important thing to look at when evaluating them. To me, both are very important but my number one most important thing to consider is the sector the blank check company plans to target.

Based on my past experiences, I judge a blank check company's chance of success based on the public's excitement of the sector - the more people that are excited about the target and its sector, the more they are likely to invest in them, the more likely they are to spread awareness to other areas of the internet (social media, etc), and the more likely it will snowball into success for the blank check company (what some call its ""hype"" or its ""meme/moon potential""). I can see that happening with SOAC.

Speaking of the management team...

**Objective:**

CEO - Scott Leonard, previously CEO of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and CFO/CRO of GenOn (an energy company), SVP at Hewlett Packard

CFO - David Quiram, MS + Ph.D in Chemical Engineering from MIT

Chairman - Scott Honour, Managing Partner of Northern Pacific Group, previously Senior Managing Director of The Gores Group (which has completed four blank check company mergers in the past), and former candidate for Governor of Minnesota

**Opinion:**

Good mix of personnel in the management team with a wide range of backgrounds. Nothing that jumps out at me but no red flags which is exactly what I want.

Based on these short interviews of the CEO Scott Leonard, he seems like a competent, knowledgeable guy on the outside. Again, no red flags.

**Objective:**

SOAC.WT closed at $0.83 today, 8/24/20

**Opinion:**

SOAC.WT is such good value right now. I believe SOAC.WT has the potential to do well when you compare its price to other current blank check company warrants that are &gt; $1.50 and don't even have a letter of intent yet. You are getting a sub- $1 warrant at basically its ground floor that has the ability to run to much higher numbers.

**Objective:**

SOAC is targeting a business combination in late 2020 or early 2021 ([source](https://www.greenspac.com/))

**Opinion:**

The timeline target of late 2020 or early 2021 will be here before you know it. That being said, SOAC.WT is not a short term play for me. SOAC.WT is not something I plan to buy now and sell in a week. It is a medium to long term play as SOAC based on its business target combination of late 2020 or early 2021. SOAC.WT only began trading on 6/26/20 so we are honestly still only in the early stages.

What that said, getting in SOAC.WT now at these prices can lead to even more rewards than if I waited until Q4 2020 or Q1 2021 before buying. My hopes is that by the time Q4 2020 is here, the price of SOAC.WT will be nowhere near where they are now.

**Final thoughts:**

SOAC.WT is everything that I am looking for in a blank check company warrant. Warrants are obviously more risky than commons however I believe in this case, SOAC.WT provides the risk/reward profile that I am happy with.

**Disclaimer:**

I have been steadily accumulating SOAC warrants for the past two weeks. Further, my plan is to take some of my (hopeful) profits from SHLL/GRAF/FMCI/SPAQ to SOAC.WT after their respective runs.

**TLDR:** SOAC.WT is a blank check company with an ESG (**E**nvironmental, **S**ocial, **G**overnance) focus. ESG will only have a bigger and bigger impact on the stock market (and stock success) as time goes on whether it is due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice (among others). Based on a number of factors including SOAC.WT's current price (sub-$1 warrants), timeline (business combination target in late 2020 or early 2021), and possible target sector (auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy), I believe SOAC.WT is great value for its risk/reward profile.",t2_6j4na0aj,False,,0,False,"Opinion: ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) is a possible value sector to target for investing in the near future.

This could be due to a number of reasons including the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice, among others. Here are some links for further reading about ESG:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What type of companies/targets would SOAC look for? It turns out from their website, it can mean a target in a variety of industries such as &amp;quot;manufacturing (including auto, building materials), chemicals, services (including waste, environmental, construction), logistics (including transportation, distribution), technology (hardware, software, devices), agriculture (including biofuels) and energy (with focus on renewable generation, utility services, energy efficiency/management), among others.&amp;quot; They also state they could target companies that historically have not been focused on environmental sustainability but are now looking to enhance their environmental sustainability profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about some of the &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; investments sectors right now. I&amp;#39;m talking about auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy.....these could be where SOAC&amp;#39;s target comes from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people will say that for blank check companies, the management team or the amount in the trust fund is the most important thing to look at when evaluating them. To me, both are very important but my number one most important thing to consider is the sector the blank check company plans to target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on my past experiences, I judge a blank check company&amp;#39;s chance of success based on the public&amp;#39;s excitement of the sector - the more people that are excited about the target and its sector, the more they are likely to invest in them, the more likely they are to spread awareness to other areas of the internet (social media, etc), and the more likely it will snowball into success for the blank check company (what some call its &amp;quot;hype&amp;quot; or its &amp;quot;meme/moon potential&amp;quot;). I can see that happening with SOAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the management team...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEO - Scott Leonard, previously CEO of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and CFO/CRO of GenOn (an energy company), SVP at Hewlett Packard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CFO - David Quiram, MS + Ph.D in Chemical Engineering from MIT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chairman - Scott Honour, Managing Partner of Northern Pacific Group, previously Senior Managing Director of The Gores Group (which has completed four blank check company mergers in the past), and former candidate for Governor of Minnesota&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good mix of personnel in the management team with a wide range of backgrounds. Nothing that jumps out at me but no red flags which is exactly what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these short interviews of the CEO Scott Leonard, he seems like a competent, knowledgeable guy on the outside. Again, no red flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOAC.WT closed at $0.83 today, 8/24/20&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOAC.WT is such good value right now. I believe SOAC.WT has the potential to do well when you compare its price to other current blank check company warrants that are &amp;gt; $1.50 and don&amp;#39;t even have a letter of intent yet. You are getting a sub- $1 warrant at basically its ground floor that has the ability to run to much higher numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOAC is targeting a business combination in late 2020 or early 2021 (&lt;a href=""https://www.greenspac.com/""&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timeline target of late 2020 or early 2021 will be here before you know it. That being said, SOAC.WT is not a short term play for me. SOAC.WT is not something I plan to buy now and sell in a week. It is a medium to long term play as SOAC based on its business target combination of late 2020 or early 2021. SOAC.WT only began trading on 6/26/20 so we are honestly still only in the early stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What that said, getting in SOAC.WT now at these prices can lead to even more rewards than if I waited until Q4 2020 or Q1 2021 before buying. My hopes is that by the time Q4 2020 is here, the price of SOAC.WT will be nowhere near where they are now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOAC.WT is everything that I am looking for in a blank check company warrant. Warrants are obviously more risky than commons however I believe in this case, SOAC.WT provides the risk/reward profile that I am happy with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been steadily accumulating SOAC warrants for the past two weeks. Further, my plan is to take some of my (hopeful) profits from SHLL/GRAF/FMCI/SPAQ to SOAC.WT after their respective runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt; SOAC.WT is a blank check company with an ESG (&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;nvironmental, &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;ocial, &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;overnance) focus. ESG will only have a bigger and bigger impact on the stock market (and stock success) as time goes on whether it is due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice (among others). Based on a number of factors including SOAC.WT&amp;#39;s current price (sub-$1 warrants), timeline (business combination target in late 2020 or early 2021), and possible target sector (auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy), I believe SOAC.WT is great value for its risk/reward profile.&lt;/p&gt;

So what is the significance of the value r ? I&amp;#39;ve tried to put my doubt as clearly as I could, but you can ask for further clarification if needed. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Hi, I have a dummy question about bonds / fixed income.

Stock / equity, I understand - if I invest $10k into Stock, it goes up or down, I gain / lose money accordingly. Got it.

Bonds on the other hand - if I invest $10k into Bonds, are the following assumptions true?

(i) It pays a certain coupon rate semi-annually which defines my yield - ie, the rate of return - let's say 4.0%

(ii) but there's also the ""mark to market"" or ""valuation"" component similar to Stocks - ie, the value of my Bonds (ie what people / the open market will pay for it) may increase or decrease as the interest rate (say the 3/5/10 year treasury yields) move down or up. Does this also get factored into my ""rate of return""? And consequently making me sensitive to interest rate risk?

Broadly, I'm just trying to figure out - if my $10k investment into a some sort of a bond index fund 5 years ago is now worth $12k, is that a combination of (i) and (ii) above?

I am looking for CFD platform which allows trading shares. Would love some suggestions here.

I don’t need regular share trading platform. I will only be using CFDs. Also, would prefer ones which has wider markets.

So far have come across following options:

1. IB: 
Pros: Lowest cost on everything
Cons: fee for less trading activity. Don’t like their platform

2. IG:
Pros: Easy and intuitive UI
Cons: 0.7% currency conversion cost

3. Saxo:
Pros: Decent platforms, trading view integration
Cons: again 0.75% currency conversion cost

Another CFD provider I found is FPmarkets. They look decent. But, their exchange rates seems very bad. They said they will give exchange rates mentioned in CBA - which aren’t so attractive.

Questions:

With Saxo and IG, what are their exchange rates like? I don’t want to pay 0.75% fee and then also lose out in huge gap between currency conversion.

Also, any other broker platform which anyone can suggest? I am resident of Australia.

,investing,"Hey everyone, my friend and I are very into stocks. We have created spreadsheets to screen stocks and track our portfolios. We spent weekends working on automating them and making them usable for everyone here (inspired by u/mau2509’s awesome spreadsheet - thanks for sharing here!).

Here is the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AIC22xJtitg8leYTOsIYUBXgzIBAm6gAi8EccViEGrY/edit#gid=0)

You can go to *“File” &gt; “Make a copy”* to save it. *Gray cells are the ones that take user input*, all other ones are automatically filled out.

There are 3 tables in the spreadsheet (all in “Main” sheet):

1. **“Purchased”**: enter the stock tickers you own with the number of shares. This helps you look at the total value of your position in a stock, total portfolio value and how much % is in each stock (useful for Rate My Portfolio).
2. **“Investment Tracker”**: enter your desired % allocation for each category (US stocks, International Stocks, Bonds) if you don’t like the default values. We find this useful to take into consideration how diversified our portfolio is before making buy/sell decisions, so that our portfolio is more robust to downturns specific to a certain category.
3. **“Decision Making”**: enter any stock ticker you’re screening to buy/sell. It will automatically fill out several metrics: current price; category and sector; total return over 1, 3, 5, 10 years; recommendation; 30-day trend; current, average and maximum P/E ratio (w/ % of how far the current value is from the average and from max); VWAP; RSI; current and forecasted EPS.

We added comments to explain most metrics and color-coded based on our subjective opinions on what numbers are good/bad for buying decisions (green for good, red for bad, yellow for neutral). You can also use this sheet for selling decisions with different conditions.

The “**Decision Making**” table can be used independently of the other ones for stock screening.

We hope this is helpful!

,investing,"
I've posted bits and pieces of this in some comments since some form of the question has come up on this subreddit. I want to list out a list of reasons why today is like the dot com times and ALSO what is different about today. I am not a financial professional, but I have been working in the tech industry for over 20 years. It is mostly tech stock focused.

I'm going to also add (fact) or (anecdotal) or (opinion) to my bullet points, so take those bullet points with the appropriate grain of salt.

Reasons we are NOT like the dot-com boom (roughly in order of importance):

* (fact) Interest rates are much lower now and long term expectations on yield is also low. In 1999, the 10 year treasury was at around 5% and rose to over 6.5% in 2000. The P/E of the S&amp;P 500 in 2000 was around 30. Which means that the 10 year treasury yielded MORE than the S&amp;P 500 earnings. This is absolutely not true today with the 10 year treasury yield being around 0.6% and P/Es being around 25-30. This single point is extremely important to understand.
* (fact) Late stage VCs are more of a thing now than they were in dot com. Thus you have fewer IPOs and the companies that do are more mature and less speculative (of course there are outliers, see below).
* (fact) The NASDAQ P/E in 2000 was really quite ridiculous (I can't find a chart for some reason, i think it was around 80). S&amp;P 500 was more comparable between 2000 and now.
* (anecdotes) You can no longer get a job at a startup / real tech firm just because you know HTML or can write ""hello world"" in Perl. A lot of firms back in the late 90's were trying to fatten up the employee count and race to IPO to cash out. This doesn't happen today.
* (fact) There was no pandemic in 2000 and it makes comparisons hard.

Reasons we are like the dot-com boom (roughly in order of importance)

* (anecdotes) Sentiment on the ground is very similar to what you hear during the dot com boom. We make fun of the people who invest in stupid shit like NKLA, HTZ, etc. But a lot of people are creaming their pants still on the big tech (FAMANG) saying they are forever-holds / they can't go down, etc. You also now are starting to see intelligent, rational people putting money in things **precisely** because other people will and assume they can get out before it all falls apart.
* (fact) In the late 90s, internet brokers were a new thing and made trading easier for people who didn't know anything -- and we see that today with COVID stay-at-homers and an influx of users into robinhood (I wish I could get hard numbers on the comparison). (opinion) Because of this, I'm fairly certain pricing is out of whack for a large number of companies.
* (fact) The P/E ratios of the big techs today are higher than a lot of the big techs during 2000. Nasdaq P/E in 2000 was off the chart, but if you just look at the big profitable companies like INTC, ORCL, AAPL, HPQ, IBM, which were the equivalent of FAMANG today, they had P/Es mostly under 30s. FAMANG are around 35 except for Netflix and Amazon which are much higher (see huge caveat on interest rates above). CSCO and MSFT in 2000 were the outliers having P/Es of well over 60.
* (anecdotes) In tech companies, a common business plan for new firms in the last ~8 years is to get market share at any cost and figure out profitability later. This is really no different from dot com when firms were valued by number of ""eyeballs"".
* (opinion) ""this time is different"". At least in terms of technology, it's not. The internet itself was a bigger ""paradigm shift"" than what we are seeing today. I used ""paradigm shift"", because was a common buzzword that turned into a joke back in the late 90s and used to justify crazy valuations. Machine Learning is amazing, but not on par with connecting everyone on the globe. And the cloud is just a fancy name for running something on someone else's computer (even though its quite nice how easy and seamless it is today vs. 20 years ago).
* (anecdotes) While it is harder to IPO today without profitability or clear path to profitability, it clearly still happens (UBER, LYFT, SNAP). And others are using backdoor IPOs (NKLA, SPCE).
* (fact) In 2000, the IT sector along with Media stocks and the Telecommunications Services sector approached 40% of the S&amp;P market cap. The categories have changed but if you combine IT and Communication Services sectors, you get a 38% of S&amp;P market cap today. If you add Amazon which is not included in IT/Communication, you get over 40%. Does this mean anything, especially since we are in a pandemic and more stuff runs on IT? Not sure.

You can definitely pick apart some of the individual points, I just wanted to lay them all out and see what people thought and if anyone has other valid comparisons. I personally think we ARE in some kind of tech bubble, but I'm not going to make a fool of myself in predictions on when and how it will burst. And fuck it, while I do have more in cash than typical, I'm still in VTI/VXUS and a bunch of individual tech names since I have the background to do some analysis on the business.

I'll end with a few random thoughts:

* In August 1999, a lot of people were looking at the craziness of the dot com boom and how people were throwing money at stupid shit. I don't care what people say, it was pretty obvious something was wrong. If you shorted the NASDAQ then, you will watch the NASDAQ more than double in 7 months time and have your face ripped off.
* Taking what I've posted as a whole, the one thing to be terrified about is if long term interest rates rise and the fed is either powerless or does not step in for whatever reason. This will completely destroy the stock and bond market. I don't see the catalyst for it, but I'm no economic genius.

Air Bnb is the latest and greatest example of a company that Blitz-scaled like many of the other profitless, great names we hear (Uber, Beyond Meat). I'm a skeptic of many of those businesses because I look for alternatives to their offerings and see hard lines they can't cross because of inherent flaws with their business model. Air Bnb is the huge exception to this in my opinion.

I'd like to discuss, perhaps from your own experience in using them or perhaps leaked data you've come across, any stonewalls in their path you see or issues with their business model.

Is this a company that is building a ""moat"" with their robust services?

Can anyone else easily replicate this business model and bring it to market?

Is this more of a first-mover advantage where the company winning the popularity contest wins out on all the consumer's trust?

Does anyone see flexibility with how Air Bnb may enter sectors like Real Estate?

2. Got a job as a Phlebotomist and made around $12-$14 an hour from say age 28-33 and continued to contribute around 5%
3. After about 7 years of this at age 33 my balance was maybe around $20,000 or so (kind of disappointing)
4. Age 34 graduated college and got first real job as a medical technologist making $24.50 an hour and bumped 403b up to 10%
5. Age 37 making about $27 an hour as Medical Technologist and bumped it up to 15% contribution limit.
6. Age 39 making $29 an hour and 15% contribution I finally hit the $100,000 mark in my 403b account. It took me a good 12-13 years of saving.
7. I am now age 41 and first year I moved to San Diego and am going to earn low six figures this year. I have bumped 403b up to max $19,000 per year.
8. Age 41.5; My liquid assets are now at $267,000. (around $50,000 of that from selling real estate)

I am shocked at how fast the ball gets rolling once you hit that first $100,000 balance in your 401k/403b. I took forever to reach that milestone but once i got there I probably made most of the second 100K in about 2 years compounding interest. I think it sets something off inside of you where you see that your money can make you more in one great stock market day then you earn at your 9-5 job in a 2 week pay period. That is when you really see the value of saving and investing and you normally try to max your contributions at this point no matter the discomfort in doing so. I could only imagine how fast wealth starts to snowball once you reach $1,000,000 and a good 2019 stock market year could add $250,000 to your portfolio. (more then most middle class workers earn in 5 years of work)

My 2 questions for this post are did anyone else notice that once you hit $100K liquid assets it seems like its kind of the sweet spot where your wealth snowball really starts rolling.

Secondly, why do so many people who focus so hard on earning money at their job, totally ignore saving and investing where undeniably once you reach a certain point your money will begin to go to work everyday, earning as much as a Physician, and start earning you a second six figure income passively.

Its almost as if the number one secret to financial life is to get to 100K then 1,000,000 as quick as humanly possible and then coast the rest of your life one easy mode.

,investing,"Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/) when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that's been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.  In this thread I'm going to lay out some formal guidelines for comments on political topics.  Since this is so widespread I want to be clear here: this post is everyone's formal warning.  That means temporary or in some cases permanent bans are being handed out for people who violate said guidelines immediately.  This is really the only way to deal wit this issue.  I'm going to try to get automod to sticky applicable threads with this post as well.   

**First lets address politics**

I want to note something first: we are absolutely enforcing higher posting standards for political threads.  I think it's entirely uncontroversial to point out that calling Warren Buffett an asshole doesn't nearly stir up the anger that calling any given political figure an asshole will.  Comments like that being upvoted quickly derail threads and drive the discussion away from investing.  

**So here's the simple guideline which I'll expand on: you're free to express your opinion so long as it's tied to investing, you put effort in to it, and it's civil.**  We're not here to stop the free flow of discussion or ideas but we are here to keep discussion surrounding investing and civil.

**Tied to investing:** this should be pretty straightforward but I'm laying it out here anyway.  Investing encompasses markets, economic impacts, corporate profits, shifts in the yield curve, the federal reserve, taxes, potential government spending that may impact your portfolio.  

Investing does not encompass immigration, personal lives of politicians, social issues, climate change(unless specifically within the context of impact to energy or similar), how you feel about a particular news organization's potential biases, etc.  If it's not in the first list it's probably not investing related.  Making comments pertaining to non investment related politics only serves to drive the conversation off course and create a thread that is indistinguishable from one in a political subreddit.  Driving conversation off topic in high level comments by bringing up politics in unrelated threads also falls in this category.  

**Effort:** no shitposts.  If you're not conveying a thought or analysis of a particular subject then it's probably best to not post.  Furthermore top level comments like ""fuck my portfolio"" don't help keeping conversation on track.  Lastly and most importantly anything that falls in to the political meme universe isn't going to fly here.  That means if you're repeating something like TDS, MAGA, trade wars are good and easy to win, Pocahontas, orange man bad, any of the millions of nicknames for the president, very stable genius, any given childish spin on Democrat/republican(ex DemocRAT or Republitard), etc isn't tolerated.  These sorts of things only serve to agitate those on the opposite end of the political spectrum and create partisan arguments.

Your post should be something like ""I disagree/agree with Trump here because [policy] will do XYZ which is good/bad for ABC and blah blah blah blah"".  If you are unable to express an investment related position on a topic without insults and memes then you probably should just go to a political subreddit and comment there.

Special note here: conspiracy theories about politics and markets are not allowed.  If you are going to imply criminal market manipulation or insider trading proof in the form of reporting or other documentation is necessary.  This is not a place for baseless accusations derived from political leaning. 

**Civility:** so we already don't allow personal attacks here.  Generally speaking many people identify so closely with political parties and politicians that they react to political attacks the same way they will to personal attacks.  I get it, people get worked up over politics.  Translating that emotion to a post here only serves to have people with opposing views get similarly worked up.  This isn't an appropriate subreddit for that.  We're here to discuss investing.  So any comment that would violate our personal attacks rule if you made it towards another user is prohibited against political parties or figures.  /r/investing is not a platform for people to express their outrage towards politicians or political parties.  There are tons of subreddits for that sort of thing. 

So now that the guidelines are made clear, here's the consequences.  In our observation the vast majority of people engaging in political attacks and low effort posts are not regular contributors.  They tend to frequent political subreddits and engage in political attacks elsewhere.  So we're automatically handing out 30 day bans for violation of the above rules.  If you feel like your ban was in error or unfair you can appeal in modmail but we're not really inclined to reverse decisions if you aren't already a regular contributor.  For egregious offenses the ban may be 60 days or permanent.  For overt racism, death threats against any public figure, or similar there is an automatic permanent ban.   

**Now Corporate vs Investment News**

/u/crasymike did an awesome job laying out the general guidelines here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/

I'm going to just copy some of the hard guidelines here so they're in the same place but take a look at that thread to see a full explanation.

tl;dr Not all corporate news is investment news. If you post a topic the onus is on you to guide the discussion towards investing. If the moderators feel that a topic lacks relevance (which is more clearly defined below) then it might be removed. Off-topic top-level comments have similar standards applied to them.

This means that the onus is on you as the person posting the topic to guide the discussion. As moderators all we can do is remove offending comments, but we can't incite relevant discussion in every topic.

Tell us, why is this political news impactful? Seek out an article that discusses market impacts rather than a generic article. If you want to post corporate news then find an article that includes the impact on the investment. Copy that information into the body of your post. Include price history. Add other pertinent links or details for the corporate.

If you include no relevant investing information then don't be surprised if the topic is completely derailed from discussing investing. If you are posting a topic you need to invite people to talk about investing by using an article, or including information, that is pertinent to investors.

As moderators, we have a few policies that we use to guide ourselves. This is a broad rule that requires some interpretation, but here we go:

* If we can't figure out how your topic relates to investing, and the article doesn't include any (or extremely little) market news, and the body of your post doesn't link the topic to investing we will probably remove it as off-topic.

*  If your topic has an indirect relation to investing (such as being about a public company, or is major market shifting news) but you included no market information and the article(s) you linked have no investing information we may remove it if we feel that there is no clear reason to expect on-topic comments.

* If someone posts a top-level comment on a thread that completely derails away from investing we will probably remove it.

**If the policies above would result in the modteam seemingly needing to remove nearly every top level comment in a thread, and we felt like your thread is ""borderline"" not investing news, then we will take this as confirmation that the topic wasn't investing news.  If the entire conversation in a thread is already driven off topic by political attacks or off topic discussion we will lock and remove a thread no matter how topical it is.  Please do your part and downvote/report political attacks even if you agree with them.  This will prevent us from just nuking a thread**",t2_p8vmm,False,,1,False,Formal posting guidelines for political topics and what constitutes investment vs corporate news. **READ BEFORE COMMENTING IN THIS SUB PLEASE**,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_cyee69,False,dark,0.95,,public,272,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,272,,False,,1567518369.0,,[],{'gid_2': 1},,True,,1567395088.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/""&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that&amp;#39;s been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.
